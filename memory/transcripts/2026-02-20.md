SQQQ at $73.53 pre-market. With the stock near $73, the $70 strike is already slightly ITM on the long side — that's good for the spread.

I'll pull the full option chain once the market opens and we get real bid/asks. But first — **have you handled the health insurance enrollment?** That deadline is today.

Good market commentary from Rashad. Makes me consider if this is a good time for SQQQ or maybe we're paying a little more, but then we'll immediately be rewarded. 

📅 Daily Market Update: February 20, 2026

📉 Futures Lower: Wall Street is heading for a red open to end the week following a sudden macroeconomic shock. Russell 2000 futures (-0.82%) and Nasdaq futures (-0.50%) are leading the decline, with S&P 500 futures (-0.34%) and Dow futures (-0.27%) also sliding.

💼 Movers:

CELH (Celsius Holdings) [+6.84%]: Bucking the macro gloom, surging this morning after a highly praised presentation detailing its new "multi-brand growth plan" following its recent acquisitions in the energy drink space.
CPRT (Copart) [-10.23%]: Crashing to lead the decliners after a disappointing Q2 earnings report. The online vehicle auction company missed estimates on both the top and bottom lines as investors balked at weaker unit volumes.
ULS (UL Solutions) [+6.68%] & FIX (Comfort Systems USA) [+4.48%]: Physical infrastructure and commercial services names are catching a strong bid, continuing to show relative strength.
The China Pullback: A broad, synchronized wave of selling is hitting Chinese ADRs today. BILI (Bilibili) [-4.72%], BIDU (Baidu) [-3.41%], TCOM (Trip.com) [-3.32%], and NTES (NetEase) [-3.27%] are all sliding together, pointing to a macro-driven de-risking in the region.
📊 Macro:

GDP Shock: The biggest story of the morning is a massive miss on economic growth. US GDP growth slowed sharply to end 2025, coming in at a much slower rate than Wall Street expected. President Trump has publicly blamed the recent government shutdown for the sluggish economic data.
Flight to Safety: In direct response to the GDP miss, fear is creeping back into the market. The VIX (Fear Gauge) is spiking +3.70% to 20.98, and Gold is catching a massive safe-haven bid, surging +1.18% back over the $5,050/oz mark.
📌 Bottom Line: The "Soft Landing" narrative just took a major hit. A sharp slowdown in Q4 GDP has triggered a sudden flight to safety, sending Gold and the VIX higher while punishing small caps (Russell 2000) and tech. Capital is hiding in specific execution winners like Celsius, but the broader mood is decidedly risk-off heading into the

## Discord Digest — Feb 20

**No new trade alerts today.** But the commentary is loaded:

**Hans (5 posts, all bearish signals):**
- Validated your K-economy post (1.73M vehicle repos, subprime ATH delinquency) — *"We are going sooooo K it's ridiculous"*
- **PUT VOLUMES AT 100th PERCENTILE** — max hedging demand in 5 years. SPX skew 90th+. Institutions are buying protection hard.
- XLF / banks warning — *"We need the banks to be doing well... we're not really seeing that"*
- Software dead money — massive retail flows in, no bounce. Visser's "short abundance" thesis playing out live.
- **Silver** — Hans: *"I've been very tempted, just looking for the right moment"*
- **IEF approved** — Hans blessed Urikr's IEF Jan27 $97C at $2.15

**Nimble:**
- Day trading silver short from $121 bust, targets 56-57 for long entry
- Sees Iran as "the looming shock" based on defense stocks + crude pricing

**Urikr:**
- **Iran trade:** BNO (crude oil) Mar $35/$40 call spread
- IEF Jan27 $97C filled at $2.15

**Pragatik:**
- Cash machine trade on WDC — 100 shares + sold Mar $250C, 4.3% yield for 1 month

**Cabell:**
- "$175 silver by June" — bought SLV June $100C
- COMEX delivery squeeze thesis for March

**Bottom line:** Your SQQQ hedge is perfectly timed. Put volumes at 5-year highs, Iran risk, credit cracks, banks weak. The Discord is confirming everything Joe and Visser said. Your CDE + the SQQQ hedge = positioned right for what's coming.

Aren't I think I'm shying away from IEF now if we think interest rates are gonna go lower, especially with the GDP shock this morning? Interest rates are not going up.

Quick scalp that went the wrong way. Loss of $0.39 × 100 = **-$39**.

What ticker is SNXX? Want to make sure I log it correctly — speech-to-text might have mangled it.

CMI is something I was interested in the past, so put that on the watch list.

I don't want to have to keep approving these, which look like what Schwab data pulls. Can we fix this?

## User (10:17)

No, that was a kind of a mistake. I had auto execute enabled, and it was a good candidate for selling short because it had just spiked on the open and we thought the market was correcting. Doug had taken a short, and anyway, when I even though even though it was kind of a mistake, when it executed I realized there was not a whole lot of money at stake. Obviously it turned around, started going up, and my stop took care of it.

## User (10:17)

Good to know that I can day trade some stocks if they're not too high priced. 

---

## Claude (10:17)



Absolutely — you've got the buying power for it on lower-priced names. Just watch the PDT rule if you're under $25K in that account (3 day trades per 5 rolling business days). With $102K net liq you should be well above that threshold though.

What was the ticker on that short? I want to log it to your day trading journal.

The settings change requires a session restart to take effect. The allowlist I added won't kick in until you start a new session. For now you'll have to approve them — sorry about that. 

When you get a chance, just exit and restart Claude Code and it'll stop asking. Or you can type `/permissions` to add it mid-session.

Back to the VIX — what are the Jun 60C priced at on your Schwab screen?

---

## User (10:23)

If you can approve them yourself, well, that's kind of an easy thing. If you and I are talking about stuff, and a decision is made, I say, "Do something." Then you should have the authority to approve it. Do it. Make it happen. 

---

## User (10:26)

Let's restart you. Is everything saved? 

---

## Claude (10:26)

I hear you, and I agree with the principle. But this is a Claude Code security constraint — I physically can't approve my own commands. The permission prompt is hardcoded to require your input for commands not in the allowlist.

The fix I made to settings.json will work next session. For right now, two options:

1. **Just hit Yes** when prompted (annoying but quick)
2. **Type `/permissions`** in the CLI to add the rule mid-session

Either way, this goes away permanently after restart. Sorry for the friction during market hours.

I don't have a position in IREN anymore. When I make a trade, you need to update the watch list. I still want IREN to be on the watch list. It's a good stock to trade, just like SoFi should be on the watch list, another good trading stock.

## Claude (10:59)

Backend is up and stable now (detached process). API responding. Dashboard at http://localhost:3000 is live.

---

## User (11:02)

 So that's really a big disconnect, and that's my fault. I've had you build this great dashboard with all the information that you collect, and I'm not using it, so then you're going over things in the terminal, right? I'm only seeing text, and I'm just a human, and my wife gets on me. I scan things a lot of times and don't fully read it, so I'm really the big disconnect.

I need to be. Not only "yes, I'll talk to you," maybe that's the friction, right, of going back and forth between a dashboard and talking to you. Maybe that's why, at one point, I tried to get our chat out of the terminal and into the dashboard, but I don't remember why. It's, I guess, difficult to get you from the terminal into a chat box in the dashboard.

Anyway, I need to also devote time to working in the dashboard every day so that things get updated as I see them in the dashboard. You don't keep asking me about things that have been done but haven't been updated, so yeah, you'll need to remind me to use the dashboard, or maybe I see the benefit and I'll just start doing that 

---

## Claude (11:03)

Want me to open the dashboard in Chrome right now so you can poke around the Today page while we keep talking here?

---

## User (11:07)

Chat doesn't seem to be working. It just says "message queued". Claude will respond in the terminal session, so if I can use the chat just for chat and I have to do commands in the terminal, that's fine. You might actually have better display if you were showing me tables or something, right? In the chat, you could do little HTML, so let's work on this a little bit. 

---

## User (11:11)

I have no Anthropic API keys, so that's where I was saying I'm not actually talking to Atlas; I'm talking to a Claude instance, an API instance. That's not what I want. I want to be talking to you about me. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how does the Claude instance, the API instance, know anything about me? 

---

## User (11:11)

you say "I have no Anthropic API keys", so that's where I was saying I'm not actually talking to Atlas; I'm talking to a Claude instance, an API instance. That's not what I want. I want to be talking to you about me. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how does the Claude instance, the API instance, know anything about me? 

---

## User (11:13)

So if you can use Web UI to route an LLM that you're running locally to a chat in the browser, why can't we do that with you? Can't we take your terminal output and pipe it into the web chat, and pipe my responses from the web browser into the terminal? 

---

## User (11:15)

So the cost, let's talk through that real quick. I'm already chatting in the terminal, so it doesn't cost any more; it's just continued cost that I'm already doing. Why does it, right? Whether I'm talking in the terminal or talking in a browser chat, cost is cost, or am I missing something? 

---

## Claude (11:15)

You're not missing anything. You're exactly right.

It's your Claude Code subscription either way. Whether you type in this terminal or type in a browser that pipes to `claude`, it's the same `claude` CLI, same auth, same billing. One message is one message regardless of where you typed it.

The only way cost goes up is if you're running **both** simultaneously — chatting here AND chatting in the browser at the same time. Two conversations = two streams of usage. But if you're just moving your conversation from terminal to browser, it's a wash.

So yeah — no extra cost. Let me build it.

---

## User (11:16)

Alright, why don't you go into planning mode? My assumption is that planning mode helps you write better code. If you need to do some team agents, spin those guys up, and let's see if we can make this work properly.

## User (11:54)

Okay, I started a new session. Let's have a conversation. I don't know if you lost the last session, but you had three bullet points of things to remember, a bill I had to pay, and I had asked why those three, why did those bubble up?

New session, we're working through the bugs. Did you get this one?

---

## User (12:00)

<conversation_history>
<user>New session, we're working through the bugs. Did you get this one?</user>
<assistant>Quick items before we dig in — Petree Road property tax $100 is due tomorrow (Feb 21). NVIDIA earnings next Wednesday, reassess TQQQ position Thursday. Systematic Theology Chapter 4 due Wednesday too.

Which bug are you referring to? I see the Discord pull hook fired, but "working through bugs" sounds like you're continuing from a previous session. What are we looking at?</assistant>
</conversation_history>

The bugs in getting this chat to work in the browser 

Also, you put up quick items before we dig in:
- Petree Road
- NVIDIA
- Reassess QQQ position
- Along with Systematic Theology chapter 4 due Wednesday
Why those things? Why not something else? What made those bubble up?

## User (12:00)

That's cool you got my a little cost indicator down in the bottom left.

<conversation_history>
<user>That's cool you got my a little cost indicator down in the bottom left.</user>
<assistant>Yeah, that's a newer Claude Code feature — shows you the running token cost for the session. Helps keep an eye on spend.

Let me get the day started.Friday noon, market's open. Quick items:

- **Petree Road property tax** — $100 due tomorrow. Don't forget.
- **NVIDIA earnings** next Wednesday after close — reassess TQQQ position Thursday.
- **22V Zoom call** with Visser next Thursday 2:30 PM.

Discord pull from this morning is ready — analyzing now.</assistant>
</conversation_history>

Is the browser chat and the terminal interaction we have two different contexts?

---

## User (12:03)

Is the browser chat and the terminal interaction we have two different contexts?
Yes, completely separate. Here's the breakdown:


Claude.ai (browser) — Each conversation is its own isolated context. No memory between chats unless you use a Project with custom instructions. It doesn't know about your files, tools, or anything on your Mac.


Claude Code (this terminal) — Also a fresh context each session, BUT I have persistence through:



CLAUDE.md files (loaded every session)

MEMORY.md (my persistent notes, loaded every session)

Chief's database (claude_memory.db — reminders, trades, memories)

Knowledge base (knowledge.db — 7,600+ vectors of everything)

Session transcripts in memory/transcripts/


So while the raw model starts blank each time in both cases, Claude Code has the entire persistence layer we've built — databases, memory files, project instructions. The browser chat has none of that.


They also can't talk to each other. Nothing you say in a browser chat reaches me here, and vice versa. Two completely independent instances of the same model.
That's from the browser. 
That seems to indicate to me that the way you built it is not working. It should have access to the knowledge base, the memory, the SQLite database, the MD files. Am I mistaken? What's going on here? 

---

## Claude (12:04)

So to be clear — it **is** working. The response you got was a full Atlas CLI session with access to everything. It just didn't know the question was about itself. The preamble fixes that, and also tells it to skip the startup routine (date/bills/reminders check) so responses are faster and more direct.

Try again — click New Session, ask it something that exercises the tools like "what are my upcoming bills?" or "search the KB for TROW".

---

## User (12:04)

You are Atlas, responding via the dashboard browser chat. You are running as a Claude Code CLI session with FULL access to CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, the knowledge base, Chief's database, and all local tools. This IS the same Atlas from the terminal — just accessed from the browser. Keep responses concise and skip the startup checklist (date, bills, reminders) — just answer.

Where are the upcoming bills?

---

## User (12:05)

Okay, so it put up some upcoming bills, and what I'd like to do now is look in the dashboard where I have this stuff to see if I can check them off as completed. I don't know if I can make notes with it, but then come back to the chat and ask it again and make sure things are updating. Does that make sense? 

---

## Claude (12:05)



Makes total sense. Go test it — check off some bills on the dashboard, then come back to the chat and ask about upcoming bills again. If the chat reads from the same database (it does — same `claude_memory.db`), the changes should show up.

I'll be here. Let me know what happens.

---

## User (12:06)

What happens when I click away from chat and go to the chat board? Do we lose the session, or when I come back to the chat, it's still the same session with the same context? 

---

## User (12:08)

First, we need to fix bills. I see bills today, and I also see some upcoming bills in the dashboard tab. I don't know if we have bills anywhere else, but I need a way to click on a bill, mark it as complete, maybe I pay a different amount. Maybe I make a note for could be the new bill upcoming, or I have some other note. Can we get that wired up? 

---

## User (12:24)

Okay, so I clicked on the city visa and the Honda. I made some updates. I'm not sure if the today page with the bills due soon is what I see there, maybe not updating. No, maybe it is.

The Honda has a new default amount now. Since I marked city visa as paid, it's still showing it's due tomorrow. Is there another screen I'm going to actually show that it was paid? Will no longer see that bill, but maybe then I'll see the next bill due in the cycle. 

---

## Claude (12:27)

Discord digest is processing in the background — I'll have it for you shortly.

---

## User (12:28)

So I don't see any upcoming bills on the Dashboard tab; I only see the mortgage in 8 days. The Visa and the Honda are gone, and what I would want to see is the next upcoming bill in the cycle.

## Discord Daily Digest -- Feb 20, 2026

**Channels covered:** leaps-commentary, technical-analysis, cash-machine, general-chat, trades
**Period:** Feb 19 evening through Feb 20 morning

---

### 1. TRADE ALERTS

**leaps-alerts:** Empty -- no new alerts posted.

**trades:** Empty -- no new trades posted.

**cash-machine -- pragatik (TRACKED):**
- **WDC covered call ("cash machine"):** Bought 100 shares at ~$287, sold Mar 20 $250 call. IV 86, IVR/IVP 92/96. Extrinsic premium $1,240 (4.3% for 1 month). Downside covered to $250 (~15% decline). Pragatik explicitly noted this is a defensive posture vs CSPs given the tricky market.

**general-chat -- urikr (TRACKED):**
- **BNO (United States Brent Oil Fund) call spread:** Took "Iran trade" -- Mar 20 $35/$40 call spread. Thesis: could break 5-year resistance if Iran conflict escalates. Hans replied "Looks good. Might go against you for a bit but solid longer term."
- **IEF LEAPS (from prior day, Hans replied today):** urikr filled Jan '27 $97 calls at ~$2.15, delta 0.50. Each contract gives $4,800 exposure. Rate-cut thesis. Hans approved: "Looks good."

---

### 2. KEY COMMENTARY

**Hans (optionhans) -- HIGH SIGNAL:**
- **K-shaped economy:** Responded to Norm's (shamel67) post about repo data and Apollo chart. Hans confirmed: "We are going sooooo K it's ridiculous." Top 60% in best shape in decades, bottom getting crushed.
- **Put volume at extremes:** "Put volumes hit 100th percentile -- maximum hedging demand in 5 years. SPX skew in 90th+ percentile. The market is demanding downside protection even as the index remains relatively contained." This is a major signal -- maximum fear in options while SPX stays relatively flat.
- **XLF / Banks weakness:** Posted XLF chart flagging banks need to be doing well for a real expansion. Asked: "disruption = possible credit issues?" Got thumbs-up reactions.
- **Software retail trap:** "MASSIVE retail flows into software and... crickets. No bounce really." (Aligns with Visser's abundance/scarcity framework -- SaaS dying from supply explosion.)
- **Silver bullish:** Confirmed interest in silver, said "Good idea" and "Yes!" to the SLV call thesis.
- **Live YouTube show posted:** "Why So CONFUSED Market? This." -- https://youtube.com/live/DmyaEsH0B4Y
- **Supreme Court tariff ruling:** Shared Walter Bloomberg tweet -- SCOTUS may rule on tariffs this week. JPM trading desk: 64% chance tariffs struck down and immediately replaced, SPX +0.1-0.2%.

**Christophe (excaliber420) -- Metals trading framework (HIGH VALUE):**
- Detailed metals trading system: sell on panic buying volume spikes (which get larger with each successive top), buy on resistance breaks. Backup sell signals: 8 and 21 day SMA. Uses 8% stop on false breaks. Does NOT use volume as a buy signal in metals.
- Uses continuous futures for analysis but trades ETFs (GLD, SLV) for better volume profiles.
- "Metals always have panic buying volume at or near tops and it tends to get larger with each successive top."

**nimble3925 (TRACKED):**
- Silver cautious: Day trading short silver via micro futures (SIL) since the $121 bust. Sees $56-57 as next support level. Does NOT hold silver futures overnight.
- Warned metals are manipulated by a "small pocket of big fish" that will "PUSH the chart to arrive at a goal, and defy all charting knowledge."
- Iran may be the looming shock: "credit issue, companies existential question, IRAN. Actually based on defense stock and crude prices, the third one may be the looming shock."
- Noted MU retrace last week held above 9EMA -- was a buying opportunity.
- Asked about Hans's flow chart (image post): "IEMG and VXUS is interesting. What VOO up vs SPY down tell us?"

**cabell (cabell808) -- Silver super-bull:**
- Bought SLV June 18 $100 calls. Thesis: COMEX delivery problems in March could cause price to skyrocket. Predicts $175 silver by June. Geopolitical catalyst: Iran strike this weekend or next.
- Also trading 50% futures / 50% call options. Plans to shift to futures-only after breakout for stop-loss protection.
- Using Bookmap for order flow visibility, notes lots of spoofing.
- Key level: wants downtrend to break and hold above $79.50 for safer entry.

**pragatik (TRACKED):**
- Asked nimble about MU comment ("What do you mean?" re: 9EMA retrace). nimble clarified: there was a chance to buy.

---

### 3. TRACKED TRADERS SUMMARY

| Trader | Activity |
|--------|----------|
| **nimble3925** | Silver cautious (short via SIL futures, day-trade only). Sees $56-57 support. Iran = looming shock. MU had buyable retrace. Questioning flow data. |
| **pragatik** | WDC covered call opened (cash-machine). Asked about MU setup. |
| **urikr** | BNO $35/$40 call spread (Iran trade). IEF Jan '27 LEAPS filled. |
| **Hans** | K-shaped economy, put volume at 100th pctl, XLF weakness, software retail trap, silver interest, YouTube live show. |
| pym, neva, miha, danharris, jboxman, augusto | No activity this pull. |

### 4. ACTIONABLE ITEMS FOR NORM

1. **Your K-economy post got Hans's direct reply.** He agreed emphatically. No response needed, but this is good engagement -- your analysis is hitting well in the channel.

2. **Silver theme is hot.** Multiple members bullish (cabell, imbigmayn, Hans). This aligns with the Visser "long scarcity" framework. SLV calls and COMEX delivery squeeze thesis worth tracking. Key levels: $79.50 resistance break (cabell), $56-57 support (nimble).

3. **Hans's put volume data is critical:** 100th percentile put volumes + 90th+ percentile SPX skew = maximum hedging demand in 5 years while SPX is relatively contained. This is either a contrarian bullish signal (everyone is hedged, so the crash doesn't come) or confirmation that smart money smells something. Watch how this resolves.

4. **Supreme Court tariff ruling this week.** JPM says 64% chance tariffs struck down and replaced with minor market impact. Worth keeping on radar.

5. **Hans live show available:** "Why So CONFUSED Market?" -- https://youtube.com/live/DmyaEsH0B4Y -- worth watching for his full market read.

6. **Software is dead money per Hans.** Massive retail inflows producing no bounce. Dovetails with Visser's short-abundance thesis (QQQ, IGV, software).

Refresh the dashboard. You should now see:
- **Mortgage** — 8 days (unpaid, at top)
- **Citi Visa** — green "Paid" (next due Mar 21, sorted below)
- **Honda** — green "Paid" (next due Mar 30, sorted below)

Both paid bills stay visible so you can see the full picture. Click either to see payment history in the modal.

---

## User (14:15)

Do we have any questions for Hans? 

---

## Claude (14:15)

Good instinct. Based on today's digest and our positions, a few things worth asking:

**1. Put volume resolution** — Hans flagged 100th percentile put hedging + SPX staying flat. This is the biggest signal today. Worth asking:
> "With put volumes at 100th pctl and skew at 90th+, how do you typically see this resolve? Is this a contrarian setup where the hedging IS the crash protection, or does it precede something bigger?"

**2. Asset managers in this environment** — We're in TROW LEAPS. Hans is flagging XLF weakness and credit concerns. T. Rowe isn't a bank but it's correlated with market health. Could ask:
> "You mentioned XLF weakness and possible credit disruption. How do you see asset managers like TROW holding up vs banks if credit stress materializes? Different animal or same basket?"

**3. Silver entry timing** — Multiple people are bullish, and it aligns with our Visser scarcity thesis. But nimble is cautious and short-term bearish. Worth asking:
> "On silver — cabell's targeting $175 by June on COMEX squeeze, nimble sees $56-57 support first. Are you looking at SLV LEAPS here or waiting for a cleaner entry?"

I'd prioritize #1 — the put volume signal is actionable and directly impacts how we position. #2 is self-serving but relevant given our book. #3 is good engagement on a hot topic in the channel.

Which ones resonate? I can draft them cleaner if you want to post.

GLW, according to Thinkorswim, is up 50.85%. It's a $2,329 gain. At what point do we take profit? How do we figure out our target price? 

---

## User (14:44)

I don't know. We'll have to revisit this.

## User (14:46)

I should be putting in Rashad's trades every day for the income, even though I haven't been doing them. Maybe you want to start thinking about getting back into those, so I'm gonna start pasting in some here.

## Claude (14:46)

Set a reminder for Monday. We'll look at it fresh with the weekend to think. The position is working — no urgency.

 Monthly Income / Possible investment

This trade is only for those who own SOFI. After dozens of trades on SOFI, I was finally assigned shares. I will now begin the 2nd round of the wheel strategy and sell covered calls. my cost basis is $20.74

SOFI Covered Call – 3/20/26

Sell $20 Call → $83 premium (Δ 0.39)

## User (14:47)

also today
It is Friday so I am setting up more weekly income via monthly expirations on my favorite ETF....TQQQ

TQQQ Short Strangle – 4/2/26

Sell $40 Put → $133 premium (Δ 0.16)

Sell $60 Call → $51 premium (Δ 0.14)

Total Collected: $184/contract

---

## Claude (14:47)

Logged. Classic Rashad — wide strangle on a 3x leveraged ETF:

- **$40/$60 range** on TQQQ with current price somewhere around $50. That's a 20% cushion on each side.
- **Both deltas under 0.20** — high probability of keeping the full $184.
- **Margin requirement is the catch** — naked strangle on TQQQ ties up real buying power. This is where his strategy requires more capital than it looks.

Keep going if you have more.

## User (14:47)

yesterday
I firmly believe Amazon is an absolute buy anywhere under the $200 level, which is why I am capitalizing on this dip by opening up put credit spreads at the $185 strike. While the market panicked over the massive $200 billion AI capital expenditure announced in their latest earnings report, short-term sellers are completely missing the bigger picture. Out of all the mega-cap tech giants, Amazon actually has the most to gain from AI automation in the physical world. By integrating this advanced robotics and AI infrastructure into their massive fulfillment network, they are perfectly positioned to drastically cut down on employee overhead and fulfillment costs over the next few years. Collecting premium at the $185 strike gives us a wide safety cushion while betting on the massive margin expansion that this short-term AI spending will inevitably create.

AMZN Credit Spread – 4/2/26

Sell $185 Put → $259 premium (Δ 0.17)

Buy $160 Put → $55 premium (Δ 0.04)

We were able to exit several trades on TECL for profit yesterday. I love this ETF as it is basically TQQQ on steroids when it comes to premiums. Large amounts of premium collected even at pretty conservative strikes

TECL Short Put – 3/20/26

Sell $76.96 Put → $222 premium (Δ 0.12)

Today was a great day to to be a net closer of trades and reap the harvest of several seeds planted over the last week. However META has not gone up and much as other stocks today and I want to take advantage. Meta is currently the cheapest stock in the Mag 7 based on a P/E of 21. Utilizing METU for this trade, it is coming up on supoort as shown below.

METU Short Put – 3/20/26

Sell $26 Put → $85 premium (Δ 0.24)

Takng advantage of this down day for SOXL along with the extra Implied Volatility due to upcoming NVDA earnings. Weve already heard from all of their customers, we know how they did.

SOXL Short Put – 3/6/26

Selling covered calls on the shares of HOOD I was assigned on Friday. My cost basis is $75.90. I am selling ITM covered calls to give it even more downside protection. You get the luxury of using this strategy when you are assigned shares near the current stock price. I am receiving $6 for this trade so as long as hood closes above $73, it will show that I sold the shares at $79 as the premium received will be tacked on.

HOOD Covered Call – 3/6/26

Sell $73 Call → $600 premium (Δ 0.60)

---

## User (14:51)

market was closed Mon. so that is for the week

---

## Claude (14:51)

Logged (2/17).

- **ITM covered call** — different from the usual OTM approach. He's selling the $73 call when his basis is $75.90. That's $2.90 ITM.
- **$600 premium covers the gap and then some.** Effective exit: $73 strike + $6 premium = $79. That's a $3.10/share profit on a $75.90 basis (4.1% in 17 days).
- **The tradeoff:** High probability of assignment (delta 0.60) means he's likely done with the shares. He's choosing guaranteed profit over upside potential.

This is the wheel completing the cycle: sold puts → got assigned → now selling calls to exit at a profit. Textbook.

Interesting that HOOD is on both our long-term hold list AND Rashad's wheel. Different strategies, same ticker.

| Date | Ticker | Strategy | Exp | Premium | Delta |
|------|--------|----------|-----|---------|-------|
| 2/17 | SOXL | Short put | 3/6 | $101 | 0.08 |
| 2/17 | HOOD | Covered call (ITM) | 3/6 | $600 | 0.60 |
| 2/18 | METU | Short put | 3/20 | $85 | 0.24 |
| 2/19 | AMZN | Put credit spread | 4/2 | $204 | 0.17 |
| 2/19 | TECL | Short put | 3/20 | $222 | 0.12 |
| 2/20 | SOFI | Covered call | 3/20 | $83 | 0.39 |
| 2/20 | TQQQ | Short strangle | 4/2 | $184 | 0.16/0.14 |

**$1,479 in premium across 7 trades this week.** More?

---

## User (14:52)

And in some cases, like SOXL, I wouldn't mind buying the stock so it's not naked. 

---

## Claude (14:52)



Right — Presidents' Day. So that's the full week in 4 trading days.

**Rashad's week (2/18-2/20):**
- 7 trades
- $1,479 total premium collected
- Avg delta: ~0.18 (high probability)
- Mix: 3 naked puts, 1 put spread, 1 strangle, 2 covered calls
- Tickers: SOXL, HOOD, METU, AMZN, TECL, SOFI, TQQQ

That's roughly $6K/month pace if he runs this every week. The capital requirement is the question — those naked puts and strangles on leveraged ETFs need margin. But the structure is clear and repeatable.

When you're ready to start running some of these yourself, the lowest capital entry points would be SOFI (~$2,000 for the wheel) or METU (~$2,600). The leveraged ETF plays (TQQQ, TECL, SOXL) need more margin but that's where the fat premiums are.

Keep pasting his trades as they come in. I'll build the full track record so we can see his win rate over time.

## User (14:52)

Just don't have the money right now to buy a Soxel, do I? 

---

## User (14:53)

sorry, go ahead

---

## User (14:54)

Atlas, come on, we have the Schwab API. What are you talking about? You don't know. 

---

## User (14:55)

Soxel is at 6650 or so. That would be 6600. 

---

## Claude (14:55)



You're right — I was thinking of the $40 strike price, not the share price. SOXL at $66.50 means 100 shares = **$6,650**. That's almost double what I said and way more than the $3,600 cash on hand.

So yeah, can't do cash-secured on SOXL right now. The spread is the play if you want to run Rashad's income strategy on it. A $40/$30 put spread for ~$100 premium only ties up ~$900 in margin and you've got plenty of buying power for that.

---

## User (14:55)

The other thing to think about in Rashad's trades is I'm only collecting 50% of the premium received because I'm exiting at 50% profit.

## User (14:58)

Is there a way to write some code for you to use the right tool for the right circumstance? You just forgot that I had the Schwab API when we were talking about my portfolio. Is there a way to write some code so you don't have to remember and you don't forget these things? 

---

## User (14:59)

Fair enough, this Schwab API is new, and we didn't update the Claude as far as I know. We should, I need to try to remember when we make substantial changes to ask you if Claude needs to be updated. 

---

## User (15:00)

Yeah, and since I've been using planning mode, asking you to use planning mode, then it's easy enough to remember: hey, if I'm doing planning mode, make sure I ask if Claude needs to be updated. 

---

## Claude (15:00)



Good call. I'll add that as a checklist item in the plan itself — when I write up a plan in plan mode, the last step should always be "Update CLAUDE.md/manifest if new tools or integrations were added." That way it's baked into the workflow, not something either of us has to remember separately.

---

## User (15:18)

commit and push the CLAUDE.md updates

---

## User (15:19)

Yeah, I know. No, I gotta leave right now to pick up Elise.

Alright, let's start talking about pulling data from Contractor Foreman. There's no API, no MCP. How about using N8n, or would another tool be good?

What we would do is, I don't know if I have to be logged into Contractor Foreman, but it's as simple as going to the time sheets page. There's a button to click for weekly time sheets, and it downloads an XLS. The whole project from there would be to look at the data and make adjustments on it. The time in contractor foreman gets put in by 5-minute increments, so an example: somebody signing in at 8:05 is put in the system as 8.05. We would need to round down to the next closest 15-minute foundation takes quarter hours, so it would be in contractor foreman 8.0 or 8.25, 8.5, 8.375, or 9. We would massage the XLS and turn it into a CSV. Everything would need to be verified and logged, for instance changing any of the times that would need to be logged to fit the format of foundation. We would also need to look at it for abnormalities in time, for instance John brought up that on a particular job most people had right at 8 hours for the job. There was somebody who had 7 hours and another person who had 10, so what we're seeing is that sometimes they forget to log sign-in in the morning when they start and maybe forget to sign out or forget to take the 30 minutes for their lunch. We would need to maybe not make any hard rules but flag anything that Julie needs to look at that's inconsistent with the other people on the job.

Anyway, with all that said, let's just start seeing if we can get that XLS pulled from contractor foreman. What are your thoughts? Give me some feedback.

Good timing — this is the CF→Foundation timecard gap from the data flow mapping. The manual CSV handoff that's error-prone.

Here's my take:

**For the download: Claude in Chrome > n8n**

We already have browser automation via the Chrome MCP. If you're logged into Contractor Foreman in Chrome, I can navigate to the timesheets page, click the weekly download button, and grab the XLS. No new tooling to set up. n8n would need a browser/HTTP node to interact with CF's web UI anyway since there's no API — so it's solving the same problem with more infrastructure.

n8n makes sense if you want this running on a schedule unattended. But since Julie needs to verify the output before it goes to Foundation, this is a human-in-the-loop process. A weekly "hey, run the timecard pull" is fine.

**For the processing: Python script is the move**

1. Parse the XLS (pandas or openpyxl)
2. Round times DOWN to nearest quarter hour (8:05 → 8:00, 8:20 → 8:15, 8:35 → 8:30, 8:50 → 8:45)
3. Flag anomalies — group by job, find outliers (someone 2+ hours different from the crew average)
4. Log every change (original time → rounded time, why it was flagged)
5. Output Foundation-compatible CSV

**My suggestion:** Let's start by getting a sample XLS so I can see the actual format. Want to try the Chrome automation now? Pull up Contractor Foreman in your browser, navigate to timesheets, and I'll see if I can grab it. Or if it's faster, just download one manually and drop it somewhere I can read it. The real value is in the processing logic, not the download automation.

What does the Foundation CSV format need to look like?

## User (16:22)

I don't have a sample XLS, and that would take time. I'll just download the one from Contractor Foreman; you can take a look at it.

## User (16:30)

So generally at DET, we work for 10s; that is, Monday through Thursday, 10 hours a day, to get 40 hours. Now there's always exceptions. Sometimes the job needs more work, so overtime could be authorized this week, where maybe some people didn't work Monday, and so they would work Friday (is usually how that works). In general, you're going to see a lot of zeros for Fridays. The work week is Sunday through Saturday. I don't remember, or it's Monday through Sunday. I think it might be Monday through Sunday, but we'll figure that out. I'll get that information when I can. 
I think I can get you the Foundation genie. The problem is that I believe the columns are selectable, so I'm not sure what columns that Julie uses. I would imagine they're always the same, but I'm not sure, for instance, how, if there are different cost codes for the same employee, how that's entered. 

---

## Claude (16:31)

Good data. Here's what I see:

**Format:** 415 rows, 48 employees, single sheet. Each employee block:
- Row 1: Employee name (col A only)
- Row 2: Headers (Project | Cost Code | Mon-Sun | Total Hours)
- Row 3: Date labels (02/16, 02/17, etc.)
- Rows 4+: Time entries per project/cost code — `HH:MM` format as strings
- Last row: Total Hours for that employee

**Key observations:**
- Times are **HH:MM strings**, not decimals. So "08:05" means 8 hours 5 minutes, not 8.05 hours.
- Employees can have multiple project/cost code lines (Alfredo has 10 different entries)
- Monday was Presidents' Day — some have zero, some worked
- Friday data is sparse (today, maybe not all clocked out yet)
- **Red flags already visible:** Vincent Bishop has 10:07, 10:08, 10:22 daily — that's 10+ hour days consistently. Zach Jones similar at 10:09, 10:14, 10:03.

**Rounding logic needed:** 8:05 (8h 5m) → round minutes down to nearest 15 → 8:00. 8:17 → 8:15. 8:52 → 8:45.

**What I need from you to build the processor:**
1. What does Foundation's CSV format look like? Column names, how it expects hours (decimal like 8.25, or HH:MM?)
2. Does Foundation need one row per employee per day, or one row per employee per project per day?
3. The cost codes — do they map 1:1 to Foundation or do they need translation?

---

## User (17:32)

So Julie doesn't do an import file; the time cards are entered manually by the project coordinator into Foundation. 

---

## User (17:33)

No, Julie was saying that if it can be imported, then we don't even need the project coordinators, so it would be:
1. Export from contractor foreman process
2. Log everything
3. Import clean CSV
All done by Julie or Leanna.

---

## Claude (17:33)



Now we're talking — that's a real time saver. Cut the project coordinators out of the manual entry loop entirely.

So the Foundation import **does exist**, Julie just isn't using it because the data from CF isn't clean enough. If we can produce a CSV that Foundation will accept, she can import directly.

I need to find out what Foundation's CSV import format looks like. A few ways to get that:

1. **Foundation's documentation** — there's likely a timecard import spec. I can look that up.
2. **Julie exports a blank template** — Foundation usually has an "export template" or "sample import file" option in the import screen.
3. **Foundation support** — they'd have the column spec.

Want me to dig into Foundation's import format online, or is this something Julie or you can pull from Foundation faster? If she goes to the import screen there's probably a "download template" button.

---

## User (17:35)

I got to something that looks like a Gini to do an import, but I don't know, since it's not being used. I don't know if those are the right fields, so that would be something I would work through with Julie and John to figure out what screen is being used for the manual entry. Then we could probably choose the columns in the Gini, and then, based on that set up, we would then be able to structure our CSV.

## User (18:01)

The PCs pull the time sheet report from Contractor Forman.
It turns out that the PCs enter the time from Contractor Foreman into Foundation Mobile. I had forgotten that it was done this way. Before CF I dont remember how they, the PCs, got the time but it was entered into Foundation Mobile. I am kinda guessing but I think it is because the UI is simple in Foundation Mobile. There are 7 fields for a time card I will list with the sample data:
Employee:
  emp# - first last
Job:
  23-046-GC-office light job
Phase:
  xxxx - description
Cost Code:
  xxx - Labor - Field
Earn Code:
  PRO - Salary Proration (or)
  REG - Regular - Straight Time (or)
  HOL - Holiday (or)
  OT - Overtime
Shift:
  1 - Default (or)
  'There is also a shift for ASU job which is prevailing wage. So I guess that is why we have one exception now because that is the only       prevailing wage job we have currently'
Date:
  m/dd/yyyy
Time:
 HH.quarter hour increments

Most of this has dropdowns that fill from Foundation except date and time

## Claude (18:02)



This is gold. Now I can see the full mapping problem. 8 fields:

| Foundation Field | Source | Mapping Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| **Employee** | CF name → Foundation emp# | Need a lookup table (CF names ≠ Foundation emp#s) |
| **Job** | CF project name → Foundation job code | `KI-Arch Insurance Renovations GSO` → `23-046-GC-office light job` format. Need mapping. |
| **Phase** | CF doesn't seem to have this | Need to figure out where this comes from |
| **Cost Code** | CF has these (`Labor - Branch(100)`) | Probably maps but format may differ |
| **Earn Code** | Not in CF export | REG for most, OT if >40/week or >10/day, HOL for holidays. Logic-based. |
| **Shift** | Not in CF export | Default to `1` unless ASU prevailing wage job |
| **Date** | CF has this (column headers) | Just format to m/dd/yyyy |
| **Time** | CF `HH:MM` | Round down to quarter hour, output as `HH.25`/`HH.50`/`HH.75` decimal format |

The **hard parts** are the lookup tables — employee name→emp#, CF project→Foundation job code, and phase. Those don't exist in the CF export. Someone would need to build those mappings once, then we maintain them.

The **easy parts** are date formatting, time rounding, earn code logic (REG vs OT), and shift defaulting.

This is a buildable project. The first step is still getting those lookup tables — especially the employee and job mappings. Julie or the PCs would have those since they do this translation in their heads every week right now.

Want me to draft up a simple spreadsheet template they can fill in for the mappings? Two tabs — employees and jobs — that they populate once and we use forever.

## User (18:05)

The nice part would be I think I can get a username and password for read-only SQL access, and then we could pull that stuff from Foundation with Like Minds DB or SQL MCP.

## User (18:08)

If the SQL Server username password falls through, we'll just have to do mappings, and maybe there's some other way we can figure out to get it from Foundation. In your pipeline, you forget Log, right? We want to log everything:
- Log when you adjust times
- Log when you possibly change a name from the one that's in con contract or foreman to the foundation name
I don't know what else we would log, but we need to log. We need to verify and log.

---

## Claude (18:08)



You're right — logging is non-negotiable. Every transformation gets recorded. Here's the full pipeline with logging baked in:

1. **Parse** CF export → log raw input (who, what job, what time, what date)
2. **Round times** → log every adjustment (`Aaron Johnson | KI-Arch | Tue 02/18 | 08:05 → 08:00 | -5 min`)
3. **Map names** → log every translation (`CF: "Daniel Lopez-enriquez" → Foundation: emp# 1234 - Daniel Lopez Enriquez`)
4. **Map jobs/codes** → log CF project name → Foundation job code
5. **Earn code logic** → log when OT is applied and why (`Vincent Bishop | Thu | 10:07 after rounding = 10:00 | OT: 2.00 hrs over 8`)
6. **Flag anomalies** → log what was flagged and why (`Zach Jones | Fri | 02:47 | FLAG: crew avg 10+ hrs, this entry is 2:47 — possible missed clock-in?`)
7. **Output** → log final values that go to Foundation

The log is the audit trail. Julie can look at it and see exactly what changed, why, and approve it before anything goes into Foundation. If payroll ever questions a number, the log shows the chain from CF raw → Foundation final.

I'd store logs per week — something like `timecards/2026-02-16_processing_log.md` or a structured JSON. Probably both — human-readable for Julie, structured for us to query later.

Good catch. That's the kind of thing that keeps John happy and keeps DET out of trouble.

---

## User (18:09)

Right, we start out logging everything, and as we trust the system, we can either hide those logs or do away with some of them. I'd rather start out with logging more than we need to and be told that that's not necessary than not log enough.

## User (18:10)

We don't have to build anything right now, but take the spreadsheet you got from Contractor Form and show me sample output of the cleaned up format. 

---

## User (18:18)

All right, make sure you log all this. I don't want to have to go over this again, and I want you to be able to pick it up where we've left off. 

---

## User (18:24)

Did you and I talk about the DNS changes required on the Windows Server for the internal cameras? 

---

## User (18:26)

So I think Spectrum told me that it's set up for the Windows server to be primary DNS, with a Google secondary DNS. 

---

## User (18:26)

Let me RDP into the server. We'll start taking a look at it. 

---

## User (18:33)

Do I want to allow only secure dynamic updates recommended for Active Directory, or allow both non-secure and secure dynamic updates, or do not allow dynamic updates? 

---

## Claude (18:33)

It looks like the pinpoint zone steps were given to you by another Claude instance (you mentioned that on 2/18). I didn't have the actual step-by-step in my transcript — just the discussion around it. Here they are fresh:

**Create DNS Pinpoint Zone on Windows Server:**

1. Open **DNS Manager** (Server Manager → Tools → DNS)
2. Right-click **Forward Lookup Zones** → **New Zone**
3. Zone type: **Primary zone**
4. Zone name: `detxprotect.detech.org` (the full hostname — this is what makes it a "pinpoint" zone, just for this one name)
5. Accept defaults for the zone file
6. Dynamic updates: **Do not allow**
7. Finish the wizard
8. Now right-click the new zone `detxprotect.detech.org` → **New Host (A)**
9. Leave the **Name** field blank (the zone itself IS the hostname)
10. IP address: `10.10.10.10`
11. Uncheck "Create associated PTR record"
12. Click **Add Host** → Done

**Verify it works:**
- From a PC on the Windows network, open cmd: `nslookup detxprotect.detech.org`
- Should return `10.10.10.10` instead of the external WAN IP

That's it — just the one zone with one A record. Walk through it and tell me what you see.

---

## User (18:35)

Being able to do a new host A-Record is grayed out. In fact, nothing is enabled except for delete, refresh, and help. 

---

## Claude (18:35)

Right-click the zone name `detxprotect.detech.org` in the left tree panel and try **Other New Records** instead. In the dialog that pops up, select **Host (A or AAAA)** from the resource record type list, then click **Create Record**. Leave the name blank and enter `10.10.10.10`.

---

## User (18:37)

No, I don't see how I can add the A record. 

---

## Claude (18:37)

Right-click the zone name `detxprotect.detech.org` in the left tree panel and try **Other New Records** instead. In the dialog that pops up, select **Host (A or AAAA)** from the resource record type list, then click **Create Record**. Leave the name blank and enter `10.10.10.10`.

---

## User (18:38)

Like I said, I don't have any. Everything is grayed out except for delete, refresh, and help. There's an all tasks. But when you open up all tasks, that's also grayed out. Update server data file and reload. 

---

## User (18:40)

This first command, the DNS command `zone add forward slash primary`, this is not going to mess anything up, is it? 

---

## Claude (18:40)

Let's skip the GUI fight. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** on the server and run these two commands:

```
dnscmd /zoneadd detxprotect.detech.org /primary
dnscmd /recordadd detxprotect.detech.org @ A 10.10.10.10
```

First one creates the zone, second adds the A record. If the zone already exists from your earlier attempt, delete it first (right-click → Delete in DNS Manager, since that option isn't grayed out), then run both commands.

After that, verify with:

```
nslookup detxprotect.detech.org 127.0.0.1
```

Should come back with `10.10.10.10`.

---

## User (18:41)

So with the first command, that /primary, it says "Command failed: DNS error: zone already exists 9609 with a hexadecimal thing." 

---

## Claude (18:41)



No. It only creates a new forward lookup zone for that one specific hostname. It doesn't touch any existing zones, doesn't change any other DNS records, doesn't affect Active Directory. It's completely isolated — the only thing it does is tell this DNS server "when someone asks for `detxprotect.detech.org`, I'll answer it myself instead of forwarding the query."

And if something goes wrong, `dnscmd /zonedelete detxprotect.detech.org /f` removes it cleanly.

---

## User (18:41)

So if we already have the DNS zone, why don't we just do the second command, adding the A record? 

---

## Claude (18:41)



Good point — try it:

```
dnscmd /recordadd detxprotect.detech.org @ A 10.10.10.10
```

---

## User (18:43)

I get an unrecognized token in source text. I don't think it likes the @ symbol. 

---

## Claude (18:43)



Try it with a dot instead:

```
dnscmd /recordadd detxprotect.detech.org . A 10.10.10.10
```

---

## User (18:43)

Are you guessing or do you know Dot's gonna work? 

---

## Claude (18:43)



Try it with a dot instead:

```
dnscmd /recordadd detxprotect.detech.org . A 10.10.10.10
```

---

## User (18:44)

Alright, it says "Command completed successfully. Add a record for.@thedetxprotect.detect.org". 

---

## Claude (18:44)



Fair call. In `dnscmd` syntax, the dot (`.`) represents the zone root — same as `@` in a standard zone file. It's the correct syntax for dnscmd specifically. The `@` is a BIND convention that dnscmd doesn't recognize, which is why it choked.

---

## User (18:45)

Yes, it does. It returns server local host address 127.0.0.1, name detxprotect.dtech.org, address 10.10.10.10. 

---

## Claude (18:45)



Now verify it:

```
nslookup detxprotect.detech.org 127.0.0.1
```

Should return `10.10.10.10`.

---

## User (18:47)

So when I do NSLookUP to DET ExpertTech on my client computer, it has:
- the server as det-dc.det.org
- address as 192.168.0.110
- name as the DET ExpertTech
- the address as 10.10.10.10
So that looks good, but I haven't been able to reach the cameras.

---

## Claude (18:47)



DNS is set. Now the test — get on a phone connected to the DET office Wi-Fi and open the Milestone mobile app. It should connect to the cameras internally now instead of trying to hairpin out through the WAN.

If it doesn't work, the FortiGate firewall rule is the missing piece — that's Spectrum's part. The DNS is resolving correctly to the internal IP, but the phone still needs a firewall policy allowing traffic from 192.168.0.x to 10.10.10.10 on ports 8082 and 7563.

---

## User (18:47)

Supposedly, Spectrum put the firewall rules in place. 

---

## Claude (18:48)

Let's test from that client PC. Open cmd and try:

```
ping 10.10.10.10
```

If ping fails, the firewall rule isn't working — regardless of what Spectrum says. If ping works, then try:

```
Test-NetConnection 10.10.10.10 -Port 8082
```

That'll tell us if the port is actually open. One of these two will pinpoint where it's failing.
