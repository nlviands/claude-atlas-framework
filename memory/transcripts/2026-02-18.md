## Claude (07:41)

Morning. 7:41 AM — good start. Here's what matters today:

**Immediate (next 50 minutes):**
- **MKSI earnings call at 8:30 AM.** We did a deep dive on this — fundamentals, technicals, Visser alignment. Want a quick refresh before the call?

**Today:**
- **BKNG reports after close (4 PM).** We're watching, not entering. Evaluate Wednesday after IV crush.
- **Systematic Theology tonight** — Chapter 4 + workbook, Todd's at 7 PM. Make sure you carve out time for that today.
- **FOMC minutes release** — market catalyst

**Overdue (2 days):**
- **Health insurance — Feb 20 deadline is FRIDAY.** Did Becky email back about MEC+HSA? You emailed her Monday night. If she hasn't responded by this morning, **call her at 970-400-9686.** You're running out of days for March 1 coverage.
- MediShare calls still not made.

**Slack:** Nothing new — just your Vietnam eSIM note from Sunday (already tracked).

**Discord:** No pull yet today — Chief's 8:45 AM pull hasn't run yet. Yesterday's was already analyzed (the Hans reports session).

**Bills:** Nothing due until Citi Visa on the 21st and mortgage on the 28th. You're clear this week.

Joe of Heresy Financial is holding a Live Q&A tomorrow, Thursday, Feb. 19th @ 6pm.

## Claude (07:44)

Got it. Joe Brown Q&A tomorrow (Thursday) at 6 PM. Reminder set.

Worth thinking about questions for him — you've got two Heresy breakout positions running (URA deep ITM, XOM deep ITM). And the BofA research from last night has energy/materials names showing up in their options screens (OXY, EQT, CEG) which overlaps with Joe's commodity/scarcity thesis. Could be a good one to ask about.

MKSI call in 46 minutes — want that refresh?

Hey Joe — regarding the TLT trade, do you think the ongoing reduction in U.S. Treasury holdings by China, combined with Japan selling Treasuries to defend its currency and change in us/japan interest rate differential, could create a sustained demand gap? And if so, is it realistic to expect US bank deregulation to offset that loss of foreign demand? Thanks
What question do you have for him after what we have gone over the last few days?

## User (07:49)

we know the answer to that though. No, It isn't another cyclical bump because there will be no correction in the AI bubble. It will continue right even of data centers build out somewhat slows. We will have humanoid build up, so the "correction" is not from demand; that will be infinite, but it will be from bottlenecks that will slow the build out. That could cause a slow down, but it will be a bottleneck not waining demand.

## User (10:23)

Went to Wednesday in the word, just got back. It's so nice to sit down and see my stocks are up $2,100 for the day so far, and my options are up $4,100 for the day so far. 

---

## User (10:28)

Do we get rid of TROW, or do we let it keep going? 

---

## User (10:30)

It's a small change, but my account is $129 negative now, so I suspect maybe the margin requirement or capital requirement changed on maybe a short put or short call. Let's go over things to make sure I'm not getting hurt by this large move up of the market. 

---

## Claude (10:30)

Different answer today than last night, and here's why:

**Last night:** Account negative $93, TROW at $93.85, felt like a position you couldn't afford to hold.

**This morning:** Account up $6,200, TROW at $95.17 and climbing, and Hans just posted a thesis that's practically a TROW commercial — "stock-pickers/theme-pickers market, not index/MAG7."

Think about what TROW *is*. It's an active asset manager. When Hans says the market is rotating from passive indexing to active stock-picking, that's money flowing into exactly the kind of funds T. Rowe Price runs. Every source this week is saying the same thing:

- BofA FMS: value over growth, strongest since Apr '25
- Hans: "stock-picker's market"
- Barclays: market breadth positive
- Visser: active management renaissance

TROW at $95.17 needs **5% more** to hit your $100 breakeven. You have **11 months** of time. The thesis is getting confirmed daily.

**My updated read: Hold it.** Keep the $88 hard stop. Don't add to it. But the thesis is working and the account isn't bleeding anymore. Today's $6,200 green day gives you the breathing room you didn't have last night.

The one thing that would change my mind: if the FMS sell signal triggers a broad pullback and TROW drops back below $90, tighten the stop. But right now momentum is with you.

## User (10:31)

IREN is at 49.34% profit, 150 bucks, so I think I'm going to close that. That's the March 30 puts; I got two contracts. 

---

## Claude (10:31)




Close IREN — that's the Rashad 50% rule, textbook. Lock in the $150.

On the margin issue, let me check all your short options against current prices to see what's expanding.

---

## User (10:33)

BtC +2 IREN 13Mar26 30P @ .77

## User (10:34)

Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)
  ⎿  API Error: 500 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"api_error","message":"Internal server error"},"request_id":"req_011CYFn5fSH73W2XtVZ5FPma"}


What's this 500 error from? 

---

## Claude (10:35)




That's a transient Anthropic API error — it hit my backend, not yours. Just a momentary server hiccup. Nothing to worry about and nothing to do with your account or TOS. It already resolved itself.

Let me finish logging IREN and then walk through your short options.

---

## User (10:36)

You having some trouble?

## User (10:42)

You kept getting 500 errors and weren't responding. I didn't see anything when I did /doctor. Then I did a compact, and I hope you're back. 

---

## User (10:43)

Yeah, did you get the I bought back the IREN two short put contacts I had?

---

## Claude (10:43)

Here's the full margin review. I'm looking at every position with a **short option** that requires margin:

---

## Short Options Margin Review (as of 10:42 AM ET)

### Naked Short Puts (biggest margin impact — no protective wing)

| Position | Strike | Stock | ITM/OTM | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| **TROW -2 Jan27 $100P** | $100 | $95.28 | **ITM by $4.72** | Margin hog |
| **AAPL -2 Sep26 $255P** | $255 | $265.24 | OTM by $10.24 | Getting closer |
| **ETHA -1 Apr17 $25P** | $25 | $15.15 | **ITM by $9.85** | Deep trouble |

**ETHA is the worst offender.** That $25P is $10 ITM with stock at $15.15. The margin on a naked short put deeply ITM like that is massive — essentially the full assignment value ($2,500) minus whatever premium remains.

**TROW** — still ITM. Stock needs to get above $100 for those puts to go OTM.

**AAPL** — OTM but only $10 of cushion. If AAPL keeps drifting lower, these become a margin problem too.

### Spread Short Options (risk-defined — margin = max loss, doesn't change)

| Position | Max Loss | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| AMZN -1 $210P / +1 $195P | $1,140 | ITM by $3.45, but capped |
| AAPL IC -1 $255P / +1 $240P | $1,154 | Same strike as naked puts, but capped |
| CIFR -5 $16P / +5 $13P | $820 | Near the money |
| GS -1 $860P / +1 $850P | $699 | OTM, fine |
| REGN -1 $700P / +1 $680P | $1,413 | OTM, fine |

### Covered Call (no margin)
| TSLL -1 Mar27 $20C | Covered by 100 shares | No margin needed |

---

## Why You're $129 Negative

Two factors:

1. **ETHA short $25P** — deeply ITM, eating margin. This has been bleeding margin as ETHA fell from $32 to $15. At this depth ITM, the broker is essentially requiring near-assignment-level margin.

2. **Closing IREN cost $154 cash** — you bought back those puts, which reduced cash directly. IREN was OTM enough that its margin was small, so freeing it didn't offset the $154 cash spend.

## What Needs Attention

**ETHA $25P is the elephant.** It's $10 ITM, 58 DTE to April expiry. You could:
- **Let it get assigned** (buy 100 shares at $25 = $2,500 cash, but you already own 100 at $32.85 — would double your shares at a $28.93 avg)
- **Roll it** out and down for credit
- **Close it** — buy back. It's probably trading around $10-11 given the depth ITM. That would hurt cash but free up the margin.

The TROW puts we already discussed — thesis says hold, $88 hard stop. Those become less of a margin issue if TROW keeps climbing toward $100.

What do you want to do about that ETHA put?

---

## User (10:45)

What about selling a single contract even though I got 200 shares of AMZU? 

---

## User (10:46)

20 March 2026, $32C, 30 days DTE, 0.19 delta. It's paying $45 right now for the $32 strike. 

---

## User (10:53)

Even 30 days out, it makes me a little nervous. Amazon on some good news could really move. 

---

## Claude (10:53)

$45 is thin but it's money. Here's the math:

- **If called at $32:** proceeds = $32.45/share. Still a loss vs $36.24 avg, but only on 100 of 200 shares
- **50% target:** close at ~$0.22 = +$23 profit in ~15 days
- **Break from prior CCs:** you were getting $80-$199/contract when the stock was higher. $45 reflects how far OTM $32 is from $27

It's conservative (.19 delta is fine), and $23 at the 50% target isn't going to move the needle much. If you want more premium, you could either:
- **Go closer:** $30 strike would pay more, still 10% upside room
- **Go further out:** April 17 at $32 would pay more with extra time

But if you're just looking to keep the flywheel spinning and collect something while you wait, $45 on the Mar20 $32C works. It won't hurt you.

---

## User (10:56)

First big up day  in a while; maybe I hold off on AMZU. 

---

## Claude (10:56)



Good call. Don't sell a ceiling on the first green day in a while. Let it breathe, see if momentum builds. If AMZU gets back to $32-35 range, then you've got real premium at strikes that don't sting if called away.

Anything else on the margin review, or want to look at something else? We still haven't gone over the Discord digest from this morning's pull — Hans had some big posts.

---

## User (11:00)

yeah let's see the discord digest

---

## User (11:03)

save this to the KB and ingest the discord pull
But didn't you already pull this and basically show me the same thing twice? Are you sure that you're not pulling old stuff that you've already pulled? You shouldn't be, right. You should be time stamping when you pull and when you do a new pool, the new pool is since the last pull. Does that make sense? 

---

## User (11:05)

Haven't sold anything yet. MKSI earnings, I thought, was end of day. 

---

## User (11:05)

With buying back that, whatever I bought back, I'm now 285 negative.

---

## User (11:06)

I looked at rolling the ETH. I could roll it to the same strike, and it would cost me $7, so it just seems like holding it and getting assigned at $25 a share might be the best thing to do. ETH will pop eventually when crypto in general takes off. 

---

## Claude (11:06)

That math checks out — you were $129 negative, spent $154 to close IREN, margin freed from those OTM puts was minimal. So roughly $129 + $154 = $283, close to your $285.

You're bleeding buying power. The IREN close was the right trade (45% profit, Rashad rule) but it cost cash you didn't have. 

The core problem is still that **ETHA $25P** sitting $10 ITM, eating margin for a position that's deeply underwater. That put alone is probably tying up $1,500-2,000 in margin. Closing it would cost ~$1,000 cash (which you don't have), but rolling it down and out for a credit might free up some margin without spending cash.

What's your thinking — ride it out and hope crypto recovers, or start trimming somewhere to get the account back to positive?

---

## User (11:08)

what about that discord analysis hook, it keeps firing

---

## User (11:08)

I don't know how much now the Clarity Act will Move Crypto. What will move crypto more is news that AI agents are starting to transact in crypto, moving money around. 

---

## Claude (11:09)

That should stop it. The hook checks if `.last_discord_analysis` date >= the pull date in `.needs_analysis`. It'll stop firing now.

---

## User (11:10)

Maybe even though Regeneron hasn't moved as far as it could, maybe we get rid of Regeneron. That's a nice win. 

---

## User (11:12)

ToS is showing +$478 for REGN

---

## Claude (11:12)

REGN at $794.38. Let me break down where this stands:

**Put side (-1/+1 $700/$680P):** Nearly max profit. $700P is $94 OTM — basically dead. You collected $587 credit, probably costs $20-30 to close. That's ~$560 profit sitting there.

**Call side (+1/-1 $800/$820C):** $800C is just $5.62 OTM with 86 DTE. Has time value but not in the money yet. Spread probably worth $1,000-1,500 right now.

**Total position:** You put up $72 net. You could walk away with $800+ profit. That's 10:1 on your money.

Here's what I'd consider: **close the put side, keep the call side.** 
- You pocket ~$560, your account goes from -$285 to +$275
- The call side cost you $659 but is partially funded by the put profit — essentially a free shot at REGN breaking $800
- Healthcare is one of Hans's "safe rotation" sectors

Or close everything and take the full win. Either way it fixes your buying power problem today.

---

## User (11:15)

Max profit on REGN is 19.28, so I'm giving up a lot, but I think in a month, even if I wait a month, I get another 125 bucks, 200 bucks. And that's if it moves up to 810. 

---

## Claude (11:15)



That's the live mark — trust TOS over my estimates. $478 on a $72 outlay is still a 664% return. And it fixes your buying power: -$285 + $478 = +$193 positive.

Close the whole thing or just the put side?

---

## User (11:20)

STC -1/+1 REGN 15may26 800/820 @ 9.35

---

## Claude (11:21)

Standing by to update TRADING.md once you confirm on the put side.

---

## User (11:22)

The short put vertical mark is @4.25.  I have an ordered to buy back @ 3.80. Or maybe I keep it a little bit more. It pays to keep it (time decay) but costs to close it. Can you see anything wrong with my reasoning? Push back. 

---

## User (11:22)

The short put vertical mark is @4.25.  I have a GTC order to buy back @ 3.80. Or maybe I keep it a little bit more. It pays to keep it (time decay) but costs to close it. Can you see anything wrong with my reasoning? Push back. 

---

## User (11:24)

My account is now showing $648.60 positive. 

---

## User (11:25)

Yeah, I show options buying power at ~$10,720 or so 

---

## User (11:26)

MKSI is down Nearly 5%, you are right. It was a morning report, $2.51 estimated, $2.47 actual, so slight disappointment. 

---

## User (11:28)

Oh no, I want to own it. I think long term it's a good play, and we need to continue to watch it in the next several days if I end up doing something, but long term, watch it in the next following weeks. 

---

## User (11:28)

Add these comments to the MKSI report if we have one. Update the report.

---

## User (11:33)

Pre-filled comment is "commit and push". Is that just kind of a random pre-filled comment for me? We didn't really do anything that needs this code. Well, no, you did a little code in the MKSI viscer alignment MD. Yeah, I suppose you should commit that. 

---

## User (11:37)

All right, let's talk about CIFR. I'm wondering if the thesis needs to change on that. Hyperscaler, the short put spread I have. I got five contracts. It's a 1613 short put spread. What do you think of buying back the short 16 puts? That would be a $250 loss, but with Cypher at $15.92, that would kind of get me out of trouble. I'd have coverage if Cypher keeps going down. The call spread is not doing anything for me; that's also a loss. Maybe I just get out of the hole position, $402 loss.

It does have 120 days to go, but with all the stuff we're learning in the last few days, the thesis for Cypher going up is not a good one. If you need to look at fundamentals and technical analysis, go ahead and do that, along with market sentiment on it. If you can find that the question is: are the hyperscalers' data center going up? These guys are Bitcoin miners rotated to providing, I assume, AI inference, so not scarcity; well, I suppose it is scarcity computed scarce. When you have the big guys building out gigawatts, what do these guys have? Look into that; let's talk about it, come up with a thesis, push back.

### CIFR -- $16 Strike is Contested Territory

**Price Action:** $15.97 right now, up +2.1% intraday. Closed at $15.64 yesterday -- below $16. Two of the last three sessions closed below your strike.

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $15.89 (38.2% Fib -- holding right now), $14.95 (yesterday's low), $14.52, $12.64 (Feb 5 panic bottom)
- Resistance: $16.43 (20-SMA), $16.69 (50-SMA), $17.50 (descending channel ceiling)

**Technicals:**
- RSI: 39.1 -- approaching oversold but not there yet
- MACD: Bearish, histogram flat at zero (momentum stalling)
- Trend: Downtrend. Lower highs ($19.70 -> $19.31 -> $17.96 -> $17.51 -> $16.17), lower lows. Price below both the 20-SMA ($16.43) and 50-SMA ($16.69). 200-SMA at $11.47 is far below -- long-term trend still intact.

**Volume:** Elevated overall (34.8M 10-day avg) but declining from the Feb 4-5 panic spike. Volume is not increasing on bounces, which means there's no clear accumulation signal yet.

**Miner Comparison:** CIFR is outperforming pure miners -- down -15.3% over 1 month vs MARA -32.8%, IREN -25.2%. The HPC premium is providing a floor. CIFR's 30-day beta to BTC is only 0.6x, which is unusually low for a miner. CORZ (also pivoting to HPC) is the closest comp and is holding up similarly.

**Chart Pattern:** Descending channel, not a head-and-shoulders. The Feb 4-5 washout was a liquidity event from the $2B notes offering, not a structural break. But the subsequent bounce to $17.10 has faded -- the stock couldn't hold the recovery.

**BTC context:** Bitcoin at $67,135 -- well below the ~$90K threshold the deep dive flagged for mining profitability. This makes the HPC pivot even more critical.

**The $16 question:** 13 of the last 20 sessions closed above $16, but the below-$16 closes are clustering in the most recent days. The stock is right at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement ($15.89). If that breaks, the next target is $14.50-15.00. If it holds, the stock could reclaim $16+ and consolidate.

**Feb 24 earnings is everything.** With 120 DTE, the puts have time. But CIFR moves 10-15% on earnings routinely. A bad report could push this to $13-14 (puts deeply ITM). A good report could send it to $18-20 (short squeeze + sentiment shift). The near-term risk window is the next 6 trading days.</result>

## Claude (11:45)

The fundamentals agent is still finishing up but I've seen enough to start the conversation you want. Let me lay out the thesis tension and let's think through it together.

---

**The core question: Is CIFR on the scarcity or abundance side?**

Here's where it gets complicated, and this connects directly to what Hans posted yesterday and Visser's framework:

**The "scarcity" argument for CIFR:**
- Physical assets: power purchase agreements, land, cooling infrastructure, facilities
- You can't spin up a data center in the cloud — it takes 18-36 months to build
- Power is genuinely scarce (this is Visser's constraint migration: software → hardware → **power**)
- CIFR has $9.3B in signed contracts with AWS and Google — real customers, not speculative

**The "abundance" argument against CIFR:**
- The hyperscalers are building their OWN gigawatt-scale campuses. MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META are each spending $50-80B/year on capex
- CIFR has megawatts. The big boys are building gigawatts. That's a 1000x scale difference.
- Hans literally said yesterday: "AI is compressing moats." If compute becomes abundant (which is the whole point of the hyperscaler buildout), then selling compute is selling a commodity
- **43 employees.** Equinix has 13,000. This isn't a data center company — it's a Bitcoin miner with some contracts.

**The thing that's bugging me:** Hans said rotate to "real things" — cement, glass, staples, utilities. CIFR isn't making cement. They're trying to sell compute, which is exactly what's becoming abundant. They're on the WRONG SIDE of the Hans/Visser framework.

Compare CIFR to what Visser actually likes: CVX (energy), ETN (power equipment), chemicals. Those companies make things the hyperscalers NEED. CIFR is trying to BE a baby hyperscaler — competing with the giants, not supplying them.

**BTC at $67K makes it worse.** Their mining revenue is getting crushed post-halving. Until HPC revenue starts flowing (H2 2026 at earliest), they're burning cash. Altman Z-Score of 0.75 — that's distress territory. And they just raised $2B in debt on top of existing debt.

But here's the counterargument I want your take on: **Is there a temporary scarcity window?** The hyperscalers need compute NOW. Building their own takes years. In the meantime, they're signing leases with whoever has power + facilities ready. That $9.3B in contracts suggests the demand is real, even if it's a bridge, not a moat.

So the question becomes: is CIFR a **bridge play** (temporary scarcity that gets competed away once hyperscaler capacity comes online) or a **durable infrastructure play**?

What's your gut telling you? And do you think the Feb 24 earnings changes the calculus either way, or is this more of a structural thesis question?

### CIFR -- The Thesis In Plain English

**What they actually are:** A Bitcoin miner (43 employees, Texas data centers) pivoting to powered-shell colocation for hyperscalers. They don't own GPUs, don't run AI workloads. They provide power + land + cooling. AWS and Google bring their own hardware.

**The bull case is real:** $9.3B in signed contracts with AWS ($5.5B), Google (~$3B), and Fluidstack (~$0.8B). Once HPC revenue flows (~H2 2026), that's ~$870M/year at 76% EBITDA margins. Morgan Stanley just initiated at Overweight with a $38 target. CoinShares data shows HPC generates 3x revenue per MW vs. mining at 80-90% operating margins.

**The bear case is also real:** The company has never been profitable. Altman Z-Score of 0.75 (deep distress). $3B+ in debt post-raise. 43 employees managing a $9.3B contract portfolio. Free cash flow of -$520M TTM. Shares diluted 22.6% YoY. And the bridge -- BTC mining -- just got kicked out from under them with BTC crashing from $97K to $67.5K (-31%).

**Visser framework: awkward middle ground.** CIFR has physical assets (scarcity positive), but power infrastructure is replicable -- it's an engineering problem, not a geological one. It's a *temporary* scarcity play that depends on the supply/demand gap in data center power persisting long enough to earn returns on that $3B in debt. If hyperscaler capex slows (DeepSeek, recession, ROI disappointment), the contracts could face renegotiation risk.

**The competitive moat is thin and time-limited.** CIFR's advantage is existing grid connections and permitted sites while new interconnections take 3-7 years. That's the window. But every utility in America has power and land -- what's scarce is power *configured for data centers*, and that's a solvable problem.

**Your position is in Rip Cord territory.** Stock at $15.95 is below the $16 short put strike. By Hans's own rules (60 delta, two closes above), the exit signal has triggered. Earnings Feb 24 is a pure binary event -- beat with HPC progress sends it to $18-20, miss sends it to $13-14.

**The critical question for Feb 24:** Does management confirm HPC revenue starts H2 2026 on schedule? If yes, the stock recovers. If delayed to 2027, the AI premium evaporates and the stock can't support $3B in debt with BTC mining alone at $67K.

## User (11:51)

Yeah, I just don't like it. It seems maybe getting out with a 400 loss might be the best bet.

What I will say about compute is that it never will be abundant. It's the same analogy with the PCs. Oh, a 20 MB hard drive is enough. The hard drive sizes are never enough. The CPU speed cores are never enough. When there's more compute, it will be used, so compute is not abundant and probably never will be, right? I mean, we hear the guys on moon shots talking about the Dyson swarm. Elon Musk is actively talking about putting data centers in space in the next few years. It bypasses the land problem, the water polluting problem, the grid interconnect problem, so I guess I brought up a couple of different things. Compute will never be abundant.

Try to reason through this again with me. What I think is that we're close, and I think my guts are telling me just take the loss.

Yeah, I skipped over Goldman Sachs because it still looks like it's playing out. Goldman is up $21 today; looks like I could take a $145 profit. We need for it to really be profitable the stock at $937 right now would need to get up to 970, right another 30 points in 86 days. That could easily happen. I'm not worried about the puts at all. The put-to-put vertical short, the 860 long, the 850 put, so it's 12:00. We'll let that keep going. You want to push back, or do you agree? 

---

## Claude (12:00)

I agree — hold GS. Here's why I'm not pushing back:

**The math favors patience:**
- Net cost: $67. That's your total risk.
- GS at $937, needs $970 for the call spread to start paying — that's only **3.5% away** in 86 DTE
- Put spread: $860 short put is **8.2% below** current price. Very comfortable.
- If you close now for $145, that's a nice 216% return on $67. But the max profit is $933 if GS clears $980. You'd be leaving $788 on the table for a position that's working.

**GS is on the right side of the framework too.** Goldman isn't a software company getting compressed by AI — they're the premier capital markets franchise. M&A activity, trading revenue, asset management. They benefit from market volatility and deal flow. Not a Visser scarcity play exactly, but definitely not abundance either.

**The position is tiny and well-structured.** Worst case the call spread expires worthless and the put spread costs you something — but even then, max loss is only $1,067 and GS would need to crater below $850 for that. Not happening without a financial crisis.

Let it ride. Check back after 60 DTE or if GS touches $960+.

---

## User (12:02)

It makes me. You mentioned financial crisis. How far do we have any indication that the yen carry trade has unwound? Are we done with that contagion, or is that still a potential issue, which is slightly separate from nations buying U.S. Treasuries? We know that that's decreasing. I think the Trump administration has things in place to solve that with the ESLM and the proposed changes to banks being able to count holding treasuries. I don't know what the right words are, but I think you'll pick this up if you don't ask questions. 

---

## User (12:10)

I would hope that if the whole world is doing badly financially, but the United States is doing good, I suppose it would still be better for the U.S. if the whole world was doing good. It makes me think about the whole Hamiltonian American system that the British Empire doesn't like. When I say British Empire, I'm thinking of the current world economic system; they're not pretty, they're not very happy about the Trump administration going back to some of our roots with McKinley and Hamilton, going back to the American system, which is just a growth engine.

We're not in a great space financially, with the huge debt we have, but SLR and some other things may fix that, and then the Trump administration is putting people to work. We're building things, we're deregulating to get out of businesses' way. How does that thesis kind of fit in with the whole trading thesis, scarcity, abundance, Cypher, and Hans? 
Well, what we know is Japan is raising rates; the US supposedly, the Fed was maybe gonna cut today. I don't know; I need to look into that, but we know that if you look at true flation, which more and more people are saying is valid as opposed to the Fed's measure of inflation, true flation gives us, because it's so low, 1.5 or something last I heard. That gives a real reason for the US to lower rates, even though I heard Warsh, the new proposed Fed chairman, is not somebody who thinks low rates are good.

I also wanted to ask you about the 500 billion Treasuries the Japanese hold. Is that a lot, or maybe that was the 500 billion in the yen carry trade? How much of those really get dumped, not all of them, not all at once? I don't think you address the whole Hamiltonian US system pivot the US is doing. I know you said some of these things help; the SLR helps, but they're gonna do the SLR; they're gonna do that; they have to. Who's the Fed chair that wrote a paper on it recently? I actually thought I had a report on that, so I would assume that they're gonna make Treasuries part of the SLR. Again, let's reason through this, ask questions, and see if, if anything, we can resolve our thesis and/or change our thesis if it needs to change.

## User (12:12)

Stephen Miran, a Federal Reserve Governor who, in November 2025, explicitly called for regulators to exempt U.S. Treasury bonds from the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)
Joe Brown at Heresy Financial actually talked about this paper, but that's the reference to the exempting U.S. Treasuries from the SLR. 

---

## Claude (12:13)

That's the key piece — **Stephen Miran**. He's not just some think tank guy writing a paper anymore. He's a sitting Fed Governor, and he was one of the **two dissenters** at the January FOMC meeting who voted to cut rates. So you have a guy who:

1. Publicly called for full Treasury exemption from SLR (November 2025 paper)
2. Is already voting to cut rates at FOMC meetings
3. Is aligned with the incoming Warsh chairmanship

That changes the probability significantly. It's not "maybe they'll exempt Treasuries" — it's "a current Fed Governor has already published the argument and is actively pushing for it from inside." When Warsh takes the chair and Miran is voting with him, the SLR exemption becomes near-certain.

And with Truflation at 0.68%, Miran's case for cuts is strong too. He can point to real-world inflation data showing the Fed is already over-tightened. 3.5% fed funds against sub-1% real inflation is restrictive by any measure.

So the Hamiltonian playbook has its pieces in position:
- **Miran** inside the Fed pushing SLR exemption + rate cuts
- **Warsh** incoming as chair with Treasury-Fed Accord vision
- **DOGE** cutting fiscal waste
- **Tariffs** protecting domestic industry
- **Deregulation** unleashing builders

The bet is that all these pieces come together to create domestic Treasury demand (SLR), lower borrowing costs (rate cuts), and a manufacturing/infrastructure boom (tariffs + deregulation). If it works, scarcity assets rip. Joe Brown's been calling this thread for a while — that's why Heresy focuses on breakout alerts in physical-world names.

This actually makes me more confident in the scarcity thesis, not less. The policy direction is actively supporting it.

---

## User (12:18)

So the other thing that creates Treasury demand is the clarity act. Domestically, we have Circle (CRCL). They supposedly need to own a dollar in Treasuries for every dollar of the Circle stable coin they issue, and the same thing with Tether, who is the big player, but they are more so huge outside the US. Tether buys Treasuries, buys Bitcoin, buys gold, I think, so AI agents continue to accelerate in adoption. They start transacting, and what are they going to be transacting in? US stable coins. There is another source of Treasury buyers which shouldn't be discounted. Maybe I'm overplaying it, but what do you think? Push back if I'm wrong. 

---

## Claude (12:19)

You're not overplaying it. This is an underappreciated source of Treasury demand that most macro analysts aren't even modeling yet. Let me put some numbers on it.

**Current stablecoin market:**
- Tether (USDT): ~$140B+
- Circle (USDC): ~$45-50B
- Total stablecoin market: ~$200B+ in circulation

That's **$200B in Treasuries already being held** as backing. Tether is reportedly one of the top 20 holders of US Treasuries globally. That's a private company in the British Virgin Islands rivaling mid-sized sovereign nations in Treasury holdings.

**Now scale it with the AI agent thesis:**

If AI agents become the primary economic actors (transacting, paying for APIs, buying compute, settling contracts), and they use stablecoins because:
- 24/7 settlement (no bank hours)
- Programmable (smart contracts)
- Borderless (agents don't have nationalities)
- No KYC friction for machine-to-machine payments

...then stablecoin issuance could go 5-10x. A $1-2T stablecoin market means **$1-2T in Treasury demand.** For context:
- Japan holds ~$1.1T
- China holds ~$770B
- Stablecoins at scale could **rival Japan** as a Treasury buyer

And it's **structural demand** — as long as the stablecoins are in circulation, the Treasuries must be held. It's not hot money that can be pulled on a whim. It's locked backing.

**Where I'll push back slightly:**

1. **Timing mismatch.** The Treasury demand problem is NOW. AI agents transacting at scale is probably 2-3 years out for meaningful volume. The stablecoin-as-Treasury-buyer thesis is real but it's a 2027-2028 story, not a 2026 story.

2. **Substitution question.** When someone takes $1 from a bank deposit and buys $1 USDC, the bank loses a deposit (which was partially backing Treasuries through the banking system). Circle buys a Treasury. Net new demand may be smaller than it appears — it's partly shifting WHO holds the Treasuries, not purely additive.

3. **Current $200B is meaningful but not transformative** against $36T+ total debt. You need that 10x to really move the needle.

**But here's why your instinct is right:** The GROWTH RATE is what matters. Stablecoin supply grew ~$100B in 2024 alone. If CLARITY Act passes and AI agents start transacting, the growth curve goes parabolic. You don't need to be at $2T today — you need the market to price in that it's *going* to $2T. And the market hasn't even started pricing this in.

**Trading implication:** This reinforces your CRCL position. Circle is the intersection of:
- Stablecoin growth (USDC)
- AI agent adoption (transaction layer)
- Regulatory clarity (CLARITY Act)
- Treasury demand story (each USDC = Treasury bought)

CRCL isn't just a crypto play — it's a bet on the plumbing of the AI economy AND a stealth Treasury demand play. That's a unique combination that very few people are seeing yet.

What's your current CRCL position look like? I know you restructured it back in January to uncap the upside.

---

## User (12:20)

The whole AI agents transacting in crypto also go back to a thesis of Visser, who talks about the real gains we're going to see from crypto being because of the velocity of money. It's not that there is more money, but I forget who he referenced, some woman who talks about it.

The velocity of money, and maybe you can find out more about what velocity of money means, but crypto prices will hugely benefit from the velocity of money increasing. Of course, when agents start transacting, the velocity of money is going to be the speed of light, not ACH speed. 

---

## User (12:25)

So we've talked all about a lot of different things. There's a lot of different moving pieces here. Can you put a report together with a summary? There are things we don't know. There are things we think we know, and put in the report where we are now, where we think we're going, and what needs to happen. I would say, just gut feeling, that none of the thesis changes. We've just been going over the details to make sure we understand what we think we know. Ask questions, push back if you need to. 

---

## Claude (12:30)

Here's what's on the board right now:

**Immediate items:**
- **BKNG earnings after close today** — reminder set. Don't enter before earnings, evaluate Wednesday morning after IV crush.
- **Systematic Theology tonight** — Chapter 4, Todd's at 7 PM. Have you done the reading?
- **Health insurance — Feb 20 deadline is 2 days away.** Reminder #28 is overdue. Did you get in touch with Becky or complete enrollment at 1enrollment.com? This one can't slip.

**Trading recap for the day so far:**
- IREN puts closed +$126
- REGN call spread closed +$276
- CIFR full exit -$535
- Net: -$133 (small loss, but thesis-driven risk management on CIFR)
- GS holding — needs $970 for call side profit, 86 DTE, no rush
- MKSI on watchlist at $250, reminder set for Feb 25

The macro thesis synthesis report is saved and committed. Everything from today's session is captured and pushed.

---

## User (12:35)

Systematic theology is every two weeks, and we met last week, so there is no systematic theology tonight. February 18th, it will be next Wednesday. 
I am trying to work on both adding me to Metashare and the new MEC HSA. I'd like to get that done here in the next hour or two. 

---

## User (12:37)

Today is Wednesday, so the effective deadline is really today to make sure they can process it by Friday the 20th. You got your day a little wrong there. Anyway, yes, I'm working on it. 

---

## Claude (12:37)

You're right — today's Wednesday, Friday is the 20th. Get it locked in today so they have Thursday and Friday to process. Go handle it.

---

## User (12:38)

Check it out, BKNG is up $97 today. 

---

## Claude (12:38)

$4,236.74 — that's a monster move. Earnings must have been a blowout. That reminder (#49) said to evaluate a directional entry Wednesday after IV crush... but with a $97 gap up already, the easy money is gone. Worth checking the earnings call details tomorrow morning to see if there's still a thesis for a continuation play, or if this is a sell-the-news setup.

---

## User (12:38)

They come out with good earnings, and it moves $3,000 to $4,000 in the next few days or a week. 

---

## Claude (12:38)

That's a good pattern to know. So the move isn't front-loaded — it builds over days. That means tomorrow's post-IV-crush entry could still catch most of the run. BKNG fits the scarcity side too — real-world travel bookings, not software getting compressed by AI.

I'll flag it for you tomorrow morning. Focus on MediShare right now.

---

## User (12:39)

No, not three or four thousand dollars. I meant to say three or four hundred dollars. If it's 4239 right now, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw 4,600 in a couple of days.

## User (13:23)

I saw Tim this morning at Wednesday in the Word. We talked, and he thought tomorrow evening would be a good time for me to go by and get him set up with his own atlas. What I found out is that he only has a Chromebook. My gut feeling is that we can't install Claude Code on a Chromebook. 

---

## User (13:29)

Yes, from what he said, it was a more recent Chromebook, probably has 4 GB. I would imagine that's the minimum on a recent Chromebook. Don't know if he has 8 GB, and he probably has enough storage space, so ok, sounds good.

We made some changes to the knowledge base so that it was searchable by time yesterday, I believe we did that. Do we need to update the project for whatever I'll be installing for Tim? 

---

## User (13:31)

No, he doesn't have an Anthropic account or an API key, and no subscription, obviously, if he doesn't have an account, so he knows he's got to do that. He seemed okay with the $30 a month or whatever, so I know Tim doesn't need the full Atlas framework.

The framework was originally, when I started with Chief of Staff, that was the whole second brain project, or it was tied in to Nate Jones's. The Chief of Staff was from Nate Jones, and at the same time I did Chief of Staff. Nate Jones also had a second brain project, so I couldn't get the second brain working that was using Zapier and Notion.

My point is that any system we did for anybody should also kind of default to function as a second brain, right? I'm not using Notion anymore; I got the knowledge base, got the sequel light database, the sequel vector database, functioning as a second brain. I just wanted to make sure that Tim's going to have the same capability without me installing all these extra pieces. 

---

## User (13:34)

Okay, so right, I know he doesn't need the structured database for For trades, but he is going to want reminders and habits. Background automation is something that we'll find out, or he may need as he starts working with Claude.

What I want to know now is: what did you build for him? The project that you built was me saying something like, "Set up a system like I have. Strip out my personal stuff. I want to be able to set this up for people in the journey of ultimately working with small businesses for them to use AI and get paid as a consultant." What did you build for Tim? What are the capabilities? What does the system look like? 

---

## User (13:36)

All right, number 3: clone Galt Framework. I'm going to be needing to sign into my GitHub and clone the framework. What about possibly putting on a USB stick and doing it that way? I suppose signing into GitHub is not that hard. 

---

## Claude (13:36)

It's private. Three options, simplest first:

1. **Make it public temporarily** — `gh repo edit nlviands/galt-framework --visibility public`, Tim clones, flip it back to private. 2 minutes.
2. **USB stick** — copy the folder, works offline, but no git remote for future updates.
3. **Sign into GitHub on his Chromebook** — most overhead but cleanest long-term.

I'd go with option 1. Flip it public, clone, flip it back.

---

## User (13:37)

Okay, so we also got to sign him up with a GitHub account?

## User (13:38)

Does Linux in a container on a Chromebook have access to his file system? 

---

## User (13:39)

All right, what we've talked about, please update the steps to get Tim hooked up. 

---

## Claude (13:39)

Saved to `docs/Tim_Flinchum_Setup_Checklist.md`. Step-by-step — two things for you to do before you go over, then 8 steps at Tim's, then flip the repo back to private when you get home.

## User (13:48)

Sorry, I'm trying to do a couple things here at once. I'm trying to sign into my detec email, and it keeps defaulting automatically. Microsoft is signing into my Gmail account, my Microsoft account that uses my Gmail, and I don't see a way to, because it's trying to verify me already. I don't see where I can sign into a different account. Do you have any thoughts? 

---

## User (13:49)

Never mind, I got it. It wasn't a Microsoft 365 login; it was the residential login. 

---

## Claude (13:49)

Common Microsoft login headache. Try this:

1. Go to **login.microsoftonline.com** (or outlook.office.com)
2. If it auto-signs you in, look for your profile icon (top right) → **"Sign in with a different account"**
3. If that's not there, click your profile → **Sign out**
4. After sign-out, on the login screen click **"Use another account"** instead of selecting the cached Gmail one

If it keeps snapping back to the Gmail account:
- Open an **incognito/private browser window** and go to the Microsoft login from there — it won't have cached credentials
- That's the fastest way to bypass the auto-login

Incognito is probably your quickest path right now.

## User (13:49)

MediShare and the MECHSA are taken care of, so let's look at trading. 

---

## Claude (13:50)

Health insurance reminders cleared. That's a big one off the plate.

Trading — market's still open for another 2 hours. From the snapshot we just pulled:

**What stands out:**
- **PWR** at $529 — your call spread is $520/$540. You're $9 into the spread with 4 months left. Getting close to max profit territory. Worth thinking about taking some off.
- **TROW** at $95 — moving toward your $100 breakeven. $88 hard stop still in play, but trending the right way.
- **TSLA/TSLL** — continuing to bleed. TSLL covered call at $20 strike gives you some buffer but shares at $15.58 is painful.
- **FRO** $33.38 — LEAPs now ITM, thesis working.
- **BKNG** — earnings after close today, evaluate tomorrow.

What do you want to dig into?

## User (13:50)

I'm out of PWR.

## Claude (13:50)

Nice — that was right at the money on the call spread. What did you get on the close? I need the fill prices to log it in TRADING.md.

And the market looks like it's about two-thirds of the way to giving up all the gains from today.

2/5/2026 BTO +100 RAL @ 38.20

## User (15:17)

Were we looking at trying to buy anything today? 

---

## User (15:19)

Yeah, not buying MKSI. Not buying booking SVX. Maybe I already have ETN. Didn't you know that?

Be good to find some chemicals that are worth buying, and you mentioned cement. I looked it up well one time in the past; I don't remember if I found anything, so we still need to raise a lot more cash. I'm thinking 20,000 minimum, but we are not going to just sell stuff to sell stuff; it needs to make sense.

Yeah, not buying MKSI. Not buying booking BKNG. Maybe I already have ETN. Didn't you know that? What is CVX?

That wraps up the trading day for me. I won't get back before 4 p.m.

## User (15:20)

Don't think I'm buying Chevron unless you can convince me that having both Chevron and Exxon makes sense.

---

## User (15:20)

Right, we have that heresy breakout alert of XOM Exxon that's doing quite well. 

---

## Claude (15:20)

Fair point — you already have XOM. Two integrated oil majors is doubling up on the same trade. I won't push it. The scarcity exposure you're missing is chemicals and materials, not more oil. That's the research to do next.

Go.

research chemicals and cement plays for the scarcity thesis

<summary>Agent "Research scarcity cement stocks" completed</summary>
<result>Report is written and ingested. Here's the summary of what the data says.

**Top-line findings:** Cement and construction materials are a genuine gap in your scarcity portfolio. You have power (ETN), energy (XOM/URA/UUUU), critical minerals (REMX/NIKL), shipping (FRO), and ex-US (EWZ) -- but nothing capturing the physical construction layer that every infrastructure dollar flows through.

**Two names stand out for immediate consideration:**

**VMC ($297.95)** -- The #1 US aggregates producer with irreplaceable quarry permits in Sun Belt markets. Hans has been calling this out since February 2. It pulled back from $331 to $298, RSI is neutral at 49, and it sits right near the 50-SMA. Scarcity score 9/10. The downside is a rich 35x trailing P/E.

**EXP ($230.03)** -- The dark horse nobody talks about. Best P/E in the group (17.3x), highest operating margin (24.6%), dual cement + wallboard exposure, and MACD just turned bullish. This gives you construction scarcity at nearly half the multiple of VMC/MLM.

**Tactical opportunity:** USLM ($104.93) is oversold at RSI 26 with 41% operating margins and zero debt. The -20% one-month selloff on low volume looks like an overreaction. If it stabilizes above $104, the risk/reward is compelling.

**What to avoid right now:** GLW has doubled in 6 months and is overbought at RSI 77. The thesis is real but the entry is wrong. OI has 360% debt/equity. CX is already up 45%.

## User (15:27)

We have the heresy member call at 6 tonight, is that right?

---

## Claude (15:27)

Based on the earlier report, the Heresy Q&A was listed as Thursday, Feb 19 at 6 PM — that's tomorrow, not tonight.

---

## User (15:29)

I gotta go pick up Elise.

---

## Claude (15:29)

Go. Market closes in 30 min anyway. I'll have the chemicals research ready when you get back.

## Post-Session Work (Atlas, 3:30-4:00 PM)

### Research Agents Completed

**Chemicals agent (a912bc1) results:**
- ENTG (Entegris, $130.74) — Scarcity 9/10. Semiconductor purity chemicals with 2-4 year qualification moats. Buyable now (RSI 59).
- CBT (Cabot Corp, $75.43) — Scarcity 8/10. Carbon black oligopoly, <11x forward P/E. Best value play.
- BCPC (Balchem, $177.02) — Scarcity 8/10. Specialty nutrition/pharma chemicals.
- EMN (Eastman, $80.26) — Scarcity 7/10. Wait for pullback (RSI 76.5).
- SHW (Sherwin-Williams, $365.36) — Scarcity 7/10. Premium valuation compounder.
- Avoid: DOW, LYB, CE, HUN, OLN (commodity chemicals = abundance, not scarcity).
