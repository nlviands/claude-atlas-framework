I scheduled the mortgage payment. 

---

## User (11:43)

The William Drive property tax has been paid, and I wanted to talk about the Petrie Road: how long to pay that thing off if I pay a hundred bucks a week? 

---

## User (11:47)

Alright, what are you talking about, an installment plan for payments on 125 Petri? I didn't think I had that scheduled or anything, or had worked that out. Where are you getting that from? 

---

## User (11:51)

Oh yeah, that's from a while. How long ago do you know when the reminder was put in the database? I think that's pretty old, and had I actually done that, I got hit with a big penalty for not paying it on time. Looks like it was 1,088, and now it's 14 something. 

---

## User (11:52)

Nice, you and Chief getting things done. That's being proactive. I appreciate that.

## User (11:53)

Doug ended the session, usually around 11:00, but he ended the session with some really good, positive talk. You know that we're all capable of doing it. We're not going to quit, and you just need to try to make a step forward every day, whether it's a $5 win or a $5 loss. You got to be positive.

I actually took on a mini natural gas contract a little while ago. The ZMA crossover flashed a buy, so I went ahead and did that. I got a stop on it, so we'll see how that turns out.

'/MNGJ26' - the mini NG for Apr, 37dte

---

## User (11:57)

entry was 2.981.

---

## Claude (11:58)

Entry 2.981 logged. What's your stop level?

---

## User (11:58)

2.951 which would be $30 loss I think.

---

## User (12:23)

Just in the last few minutes, it hit 2.959, but then has jumped up to 2.978. 

---

## Claude (12:23)

Got it. Entry 2.981, stop 2.951, ~$30 risk. Clean defined trade. Doug would approve — small risk, follow the signal, let it work.

'/Users/nl/Documents/health insurance/SALA Heatlhcare Program/Apex_HDHP_Sedera_Dec_2018.pdf'

Can you look this over and help me figure out? I'm the oldest in the household, 58. I'm not sure what the different options are. I'm just looking for the cheapest MEC with a HSA. 

---

## Claude (13:49)

OK, here's the breakdown. **Important caveat first: this document is from December 2018 — prices and HSA limits are 7+ years old. You need current pricing from SALA/Sedera.**

That said, here's how the structure works:

## How It's Built (Two Pieces)

**Piece 1: Apex HDHP / Basic MEC** — This is what gives you MEC compliance + HSA eligibility
- $3,000 deductible (individual) / $6,000 family
- 80/20 coinsurance
- Max OOP: $6,750 individual / $13,300 family
- Covers: preventive care (100%), primary care visits, urgent care, lab services

**Piece 2: Sedera Medical Cost Sharing** — This is the health sharing that covers bigger stuff. You MUST pair them — the doc says participants "choose from one of the plans above AND a Sedera plan."

## Your Pricing (Age 50-59, Non-Tobacco)

The coverage tiers: **MO** = Member Only, **MS** = Member + Spouse, **MC** = Member + Child, **MF** = Member + Family

**If you just need yourself (MO):**

| IUA (deductible) | Apex HDHP | Sedera | Total/month | Annual |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $5,000 | $71.43 | $172 | **$243.43** | $2,921 |
| $2,500 | $71.43 | $217 | **$288.43** | $3,461 |
| $1,500 | $71.43 | $241 | **$312.43** | $3,749 |
| $1,000 | $71.43 | $259 | **$330.43** | $3,965 |
| $500 | $71.43 | $295 | **$366.43** | $4,397 |

**Cheapest MO option: $243.43/month** with $5,000 IUA (highest out-of-pocket before sharing kicks in).

**If you need Member + Family (MF):**

| IUA | Apex | Sedera | Total/month | Annual |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $5,000 | $102.04 | $482 | **$584.04** | $7,008 |
| $2,500 | $102.04 | $612 | **$714.04** | $8,568 |

## Key Questions

1. **Who needs coverage?** Just you? Or Thanh/Elise too? MO vs MF is a big price difference.
2. **This is 2018 pricing.** You need to call SALA or check their current rates. Prices have likely gone up.
3. **HSA contribution limits for 2026** will be higher than the $3,450/$6,900 shown here (those were 2018). At 55+, you get the extra $1,000 catch-up.
4. **How does this compare to what Becky Otteman quoted?** The Feb 20 deadline is for the 1enrollment.com plan at code 100MPOWER. Different product?

The cheapest path to MEC + HSA for just you is the $5,000 IUA tier at ~$243/month (2018 dollars). But you need current pricing.

---

## User (13:49)

It would be the whole family: me, Thanh, and the two girls. This is what they had available on their website, so yes, I would have to call them. I understand the HSA contribution limits. I've called Becky Ottoman and left a voicemail. She'll be calling me back. 

---

## User (13:54)

Well, that was my thought too. I already have Metashare, so let's say we keep that. I just need an MEC HSA. 

---

## Claude (13:54)

Got it. Family of 4, and Becky is calling back. Good.

**Family (MF) at 50-59, cheapest options (2018 pricing):**

| IUA | Monthly | Annual |
|---|---|---|
| $5,000 | **$584.04** | $7,008 |
| $2,500 | **$714.04** | $8,568 |
| $1,500 | **$783.04** | $9,396 |

When SALA calls back, ask:
1. **Current 2026 pricing** — this sheet is 7 years old
2. **Is the Apex HDHP still the MEC piece?** Or have they changed carriers?
3. **Age banding** — you're 58, but Emily and Elise are under 30. Does the family rate go off the oldest member or is it blended?
4. **Can you do Apex MEC-only without Sedera?** If you already have MediShare for cost sharing, maybe you just need the $102.04 MEC/HSA wrapper

That last question is the big one. If you can get just the Apex HDHP at ~$102/month for the family and keep MediShare for the actual medical sharing, that's your cheapest path to HSA eligibility.

---

## User (14:01)

So, like I said, I got a call in to Becky; she should be calling me back. Can you find any information on anybody that provides an expensive MEC with an HSA?

This SALA small association leadership alliance website is old; I'm not going to get anything from that. That seemed initially like a place to check on this, and, like you said, those documents are from 2018. I called about the Apex management administration, which I guess does the Emmys or used to do the MEC HSA, and it's not even the same company. I heard a recording only in Spanish to leave a message, apparently, so forget that; that's a dead end, the small association leadership alliance/Apex.

### #leaps-commentary (20 messages) — Hans very active

**Hans's market outlook:**
- Calling for **caution this week**. Charts look "a little bit precarious." FOMC minutes coming. Watch his video from last night.
- Agentic AI capability explosion in last 6 weeks making it harder to ignore disruption to jobs — threatens the productivity narrative
- **"Not adding ANY risk here."** May add more puts.
- His hedging playbook: raise cash, add puts/put spreads, VIX plays when futures curve shifts to backwardation
- VIX spot "fairly well behaved" but **VIX futures look concerned** — divergence worth watching
- **LITE** (Lumentum) — called it "a monster," then **dumped it at $600** in #trades to raise cash. Said "probably dumb cause it's an incredible story - but market squishy"
- **MSFT heading to 390 lows** — not sure they'll hold. (Aligns with your bearish MSFT view.)
- Wondering about **big tech buybacks** going forward
- "Still love Apple. Lord help me."
- **Bonds:** Moving into **IEF** (7-10yr) over TLT — more sensitive to rate cuts, less noise from fiscal/foreign supply issues
- **Silver:** Looked at it but glad he didn't buy. Excaliber says wait for 50 reclaim and downtrend break — "end of month to mid-March" for next entry

### #trades (2 messages)
- Hans **sold LITE at $600** — raising cash, market feels squishy

### #technical-analysis (14 messages)
- Hans posted his YouTube video breakdown + chart of AI disruption (unprecedented adoption rate)
- **QQQ 200-day MA around $580** — key level
- **GOOG** approaching a significant level (chart attached)
- **pragatik** posted PLTR monthly Fib support around $130
- Hans shared **CNBC article: "AI disruption could spark a 'shock to the system' in credit markets"** (UBS analyst) — this echoes Visser's turbulence thesis
- AI adoption "the greatest new toy of all time" — disruption unprecedented

### #cash-machine (10 messages) — Great strategy discussion
- **pragatik** walking through PLTR cash machine (ITM covered calls):
  - Sold $130 CCs when PLTR was ~$143 for ~$15
  - Rolled to 3/20 expiry: bought back 2/20 CC for $4.50, sold 3/20 $130 CC for $9.55
  - Total collected: ~$21 in premium. Fib support at $131 holding
  - Key insight: "CSPs and cash machine (ITM CCs) are similar but definitely not the same"
- **kaufdaddy12** adds a twist: waits for dip, sells ATM call on rally, uses 10-20% of premium to buy debit spreads for directional moves
- Hans: "it's become a good strat again the last couple months"

### #general-chat (7 messages)
- jboxman's Mac too slow for day trading
- Discussion about All In podcast — bambambarino lost respect for Chamath (talks convincingly but says untrue things)
- danharris wonders if PLTR excluded from JPM resilient tech list for political reasons

---

**Key takeaways for you:**
1. **Hans is cautious/defensive** — dumping winners, adding puts, raising cash. Not adding risk. This aligns with Visser's turbulence signals.
2. **MSFT $390 lows** — Hans sees them cracking. You're already bearish MSFT, this is validation.
3. **UBS credit markets + AI disruption article** — another independent source echoing the Visser deleveraging thesis
4. **Cash machine strategy on PLTR** — pragatik's walk-through is a clean example of the Rashad-style income approach, good reference
5. **IEF over TLT for rate-cut sensitivity** — worth noting for your bond allocation thinking

## User (17:40)

If we believe rates are going down according to Visser, tell me about the IEF TLT trade. Is TLT going up when rates go down, or the opposite? What about IEF? I don't even know what IEF is. 

---

## Claude (17:41)

Here's the breakdown:

**Both IEF and TLT go UP when rates go DOWN.** They're bond ETFs — they hold Treasury bonds. When interest rates fall, existing bonds with higher coupons become more valuable, so the price rises. It's an inverse relationship.

### IEF vs TLT

| | **IEF** | **TLT** |
|---|---|---|
| **What it holds** | 7-10 year Treasuries | 20+ year Treasuries |
| **Current price** | $97.20 | $89.80 |
| **Duration** | ~7.5 years | ~17 years |
| **Rate sensitivity** | Moderate | High |
| **1% rate cut** | ~7.5% gain | ~17% gain |

**Duration** is the key concept — it's roughly how much the ETF moves for every 1% change in rates. TLT has about 2x the duration of IEF, so it swings harder in both directions.

### Why Hans prefers IEF over TLT

Hans said the long bond (20+ year, TLT) has "a little bit more going on with it — fiscal issues, foreign supply." He's right:

- **Fiscal deficits** — massive government borrowing pushes long-term yields UP (bad for TLT) even if the Fed is cutting short rates
- **Foreign demand** — China/Japan selling long-term Treasuries adds supply pressure on the long end
- **Yield curve steepening** — the Fed cuts the short end, but the long end can stay stubborn or even rise

So the 7-10 year (IEF) is the **cleaner rate-cut play** — it benefits from Fed cuts without as much noise from deficit/supply concerns.

### Visser connection

If Visser's thesis plays out — hedge fund deleveraging, credit cascade, Fed forced to cut — **both go up**, but IEF is the higher-probability, lower-volatility way to play it. TLT is the leveraged bet with more risk from the fiscal side.

In simple terms: IEF is the smart money play on rate cuts. TLT is the gamble that the whole curve comes down, not just the front end.

By the way, Schwab approved my API application.

## User (17:44)

I know Japan always figures in with rates. There's always been the yen carry trade, and with rates spiking up in Japan the last couple months, that's been a contagion for the market here in the US. Peter Zane just did a video on Japan. Can you pull the transcript and factor that in with this IEF TLT?

## User (17:45)

0:00
Hey all, Peter Zin here coming to you
0:01
from home in Colorado. Uh weather's
0:04
crap, so I'm inside. Anyway, uh a lot of
0:06
people have written in about what's
0:08
going on with financial markets,
0:09
specifically Japan. For those of you who
0:11
don't follow this sort of thing, there's
0:12
been a bit of a challenge in the bond
0:14
market recently. We've got a number of
0:16
countries ranging from the United States
0:18
to Germany to Britain, uh that are
0:20
issuing record amounts of debt, and
0:22
that's something that's only going to
0:23
continue in the future. But, uh we had a
0:26
scare when it came to Japan specifically
0:28
recently. So, I thought it was worth
0:30
digging into that a little bit. Um,
0:32
Japan doesn't run their numbers in a
0:35
normal way. So, normally, like here in
0:37
the United States or really in any other
0:38
advanced country, if you spend more than
0:42
you take in in taxes, you issue bonds
0:45
which are sold on the international
0:47
market and that generates debt that goes
0:49
into your overall stock. And the figure
0:52
that we normally go for is uh deficit
0:55
spending as a percent of GDP which based
0:57
on your country can be anywhere from 1
0:58
to 10 percent based on the
0:59
circumstances. As a rule, whenever that
1:02
number is higher than your economic
1:04
growth for the year, your debt load is
1:06
going to increase and that will put
1:07
pressure on your economy year after year
1:09
after year growing growing growing
1:10
growing. And in the United States and a
1:12
lot of advanced countries, we now have
1:14
debt levels that are over 100% of GDP,
1:16
which has reached the point that it is a
1:18
constant drag. So in the United States,
1:20
interest payments on that debt is one of
1:22
our biggest outlays. We spend as much as
1:24
that we do on defense uh and is
1:26
absolutely making economic activity for
1:28
everybody higher because it increases
1:30
borrowing costs. So the difference
1:32
between say a 4% and a 6% mortgage is a
1:35
mortgage payment that's about 50%
1:36
bicker. So you can see how that can
1:38
really hurt really really fast. Japan
1:41
Japan does their numbers differently. Uh
1:44
according to the IMF, their deficit
1:45
spending is roughly 2 to 3% of GDP on
1:48
any given year. But the IMF follows the
1:51
Japanese way of producing the statistics
1:53
and it doesn't count intergovernment
1:54
transfers as potential debt. And they
1:56
also count things like social security
1:58
payments or what we would call them here
2:00
as income as opposed to something that
2:02
needs to be put into a box and really
2:03
shouldn't affect the math at all. The
2:06
Japanese say that their deficit spending
2:08
is in the vicinity typically of four to
2:11
5% of GDP, which considering they've
2:13
averaged less than 1% growth for the
2:15
last 35 years is really really bad. Uh
2:19
but that's also not very honest because
2:21
when the Japanese do their budget, if
2:25
they're doing deficit spending, they
2:26
don't count that as deficit spending
2:29
because it was planned. So if they're
2:32
issuing bonds, they actually count that
2:35
as income. So their core deficit
2:38
spending doesn't count at all according
2:40
to them. They only count it as deficit
2:42
spending if it's a supplemental budget
2:44
that they have to do later in the year
2:45
for say construction or stimulus or
2:47
whatever it happens to be. So in
2:50
reality, uh Japan's budget deficit has
2:52
been in the 7 to 10% range for almost 30
2:56
years now. And so their total national
2:59
debt as a percent of GDP everything
3:00
accred is about 230 to 240% of GDP well
3:04
over double what we have here in the
3:06
United States and that doesn't count
3:08
local government debt and it doesn't
3:10
count pensioner rares and it doesn't
3:11
count the bankrupt nature of their
3:13
social security network you throw that
3:15
all in you're somewhere between 400 and
3:17
500% of GDP making Japan by far the most
3:20
indebted country in modern history which
3:24
isn't to say that the rest of us are not
3:25
catching up The four most prolific
3:30
spenders for administrations in American
3:33
history are Barack Obama, Trump one,
3:36
Biden, and now Trump 2. And each one has
3:39
spent more than the last. So, for
3:41
example, despite the personnel gutting
3:44
of the federal government uh early last
3:46
year in the Trump administration second
3:48
term, we're actually now spending more
3:50
on the government than we ever have
3:52
before. And that's before you consider
3:53
increases to spending for things like
3:54
homeland security, defense. So, we're
3:56
absolutely moving in the wrong
3:58
direction. Uh, we've been north of 5% of
4:00
GDP spending for over a decade now. Not
4:03
just COVID, but overall, and we're
4:05
showing no sign of going the other
4:06
direction. Part of this, like with
4:08
Japan, it's a pension issue. We've had
4:10
the baby boomers go from the biggest
4:12
taxpayers we've ever had to the biggest
4:14
tax takers we've ever had as they
4:16
retire. That's something that's not
4:17
going to improve for at least the next
4:19
10 or 15 years until they pass on. and a
4:22
new generation, my generation, Gen X,
4:24
are the retired class because we're a
4:25
small number. Uh elsewhere in the world,
4:28
the situation is also getting worse. Uh
4:30
specifically in the case of Europe, they
4:32
have the same demographic problem that
4:34
we have here in the United States with
4:36
that we have in Japan. But unlike the
4:38
United States where we have a large
4:39
cadre of millennials who are filling out
4:41
the numbers and in time will repair the
4:43
tax base, most European countries don't
4:46
have a population block of size in that
4:48
number. So you're just looking at the
4:50
numbers getting worse and worse and
4:51
worse and worse every year, unless you
4:52
just decide to liquefy old people
4:54
somehow, which would be just to say
4:56
complicated.
4:57
In [clears throat] addition, after 70
5:00
years of slimming down their defense
5:02
budgets, especially in the last 30 years
5:03
in the postcold war era, we're now in a
5:05
situation where the Europeans are
5:06
actually facing a hot war at the same
5:09
time that the Trump administration is
5:10
threatening to withdraw American
5:13
support. So, we're seeing these
5:15
countries needing to build a more normal
5:17
military force. And that does not mean
5:20
expanding their military spending from
5:22
1% to 2% of GDP or even 5% of GDP like
5:26
the Trump administration has recently
5:27
armed twisted them to do. They need to
5:29
get closer to 10 to 30% of GDP because
5:31
they need to build up the institutions
5:34
in many cases from almost scratch in the
5:37
next few years to prepare for a war with
5:40
the Russians. that is very very
5:42
expensive and the only way they can do
5:44
it is by basically ignoring all of their
5:45
budget and deficit loss uh that are
5:48
entrenched in the Eurozone formation.
5:50
Bottom line is there's a huge amount of
5:52
debt out there already and all signs
5:55
point to getting bigger and bigger and
5:57
bigger even if there is sufficient
5:59
political will to cut the budgets in
6:01
places where perhaps you can find some
6:03
fat to trim. The structural nature of
6:06
the environment demographically and
6:08
strategically is arguing for far bigger
6:11
deficits moving forward. Does this mean
6:14
we're going to have a debt crisis? I
6:16
don't know. We haven't had a real
6:19
country have a real debt crisis in a
6:22
long time and certainly not in the
6:25
current era we're in where the United
6:27
States is by and far the largest
6:29
economy. Which means I also can't tell
6:31
you what will happen on the other side
6:32
of this. All I know for certain is the
6:35
combination of deglobalization and rapid
6:38
aging means that the economic models
6:40
that underline everything that we
6:42
understand about finance, capitalism,
6:44
socialism, fascism, whatever you want to
6:46
call it, uh they're all based on the
6:48
population getting bigger and that is no
6:50
longer true. So we are going to have to
6:52
find a new economic model and in that
6:54
sort of environment I don't know what is
6:56
going to happen with debt. I can only
6:59
point to an example that Japan has
7:01
provided us in the past. Something
7:02
called tokusai where basically the
7:04
emperor just walks out, waves his
7:06
scepter around, declares that every debt
7:09
is null and void and everyone starts
7:12
over.
7:14
That would liquefy everyone's savings
7:16
account. That would liquefy everyone's
7:18
mortgage and would let's just say be a
7:20
disruptive event. But at the moment,
7:23
that is really the only model that makes
7:25
any sense. [clears throat]
7:26
That doesn't mean that you should plan
7:28
for that. However, so

## Claude (17:46)

Logged to memory. Worth noting — if Visser's deleveraging scenario gets bad enough that we get a full flight-to-safety panic, TLT could spike short-term as people pile into Treasuries regardless. But structurally, Zeihan's supply argument makes IEF the better position for a sustained rate-cut cycle.

## User (21:09)

One question about the MECHSA combined with the Metashare. We open an HSA and we can put 5,000 a year in it because I'm 58. My question is, can we use the HSA to pay the fee for Metashare and the fee for the MEC HSA? Metashare is $400 a month, and the MEC HSA from Becky Ottoman is $195 a month. I think that adds up to $7,000. Can we pay some of that with the same money that we put in?

One question about the MEC-HSA combined with the Medi-Share. We open an HSA and we can put 5,000 a year in it because I'm 58. My question is, can we use the HSA to pay the fee for Metashare and the fee for the MEC HSA? Metashare is $400 a month, and the MEC HSA from Becky Ottoman is $195 a month. I think that adds up to $7,000. Can we pay some of that with the same money that we put in? So I'd like you to look up the tax code and also see if you can find anything online where other individuals, small business owners, self-employed people talk about how they use the HSA. 

---

## User (21:34)

Alright, I just emailed Becky Ottoman about moving forward. See if we can get it done by the February 20th deadline so we could be effective March 1st.

Hey, I've done a lot of slack stuff in slack, things that I needed to remember, notes. I think a lot of the notes are actually to-do's. If I open up the can, can you start up the dashboard? I can go on the dashboard and look at all this stuff, because a lot of this stuff you haven't brought up, and I should be looking at Can we work on that now?

I just put some files from Hans' Discord in your reports folder. Read em over and let's go over em. 

---

## User (22:02)

So you were going to read reports from Hans that he posted in his Discord, and it said "context too large", so I did a manual compact. Do you have a memory of that, and can you start that again? 

---

## User (22:24)

Yeah, CDNS I did not find in thinkorswim BKNG. I did. It's a $4,000 stock, I suppose I could look at getting some options on it. I need to raise cash, right? I'm actually still negative $93 at the end.

You have under the section for your book trow position fits the value over growth rotation, so are we thinking tro is a keeper or tro needs to go? I mean, it was up a few hundred dollars today, but it's a $4,000 loss for me. 

---

## User (22:30)

Question: If I said, "Show me the conversation we had when I uploaded the documents from Hans," would you be able to show me all of this again? 

---

## User (22:32)

So the other important thing would be saving the tickers for the stuff that was brought up and a quick synopsis of what, or the thesis of why I would want to get into them. I suppose that could be pulled from the reports and the fact that our conversation bit has been put in the knowledge base, or do we need to do it another way? 

---

## User (22:34)

I think we talked about CRM sales force earlier today that's been beaten up, probably oversold. What do you think? Should we put that in the idea tracker watch list? 

---

## User (22:37)

Yeah, you can add it to the watch list with that context. That's a hard one to decide. I've been burned too many times by Adobe, yet I did that bear put spread, which I guess I did because I'm actually betting on it going down, which is what it seems to do all the time. 

---

## User (22:39)

Yeah, I know bedtime is important, but we're doing some good stuff here. I need to catch up on this stuff, getting away from the trading and going to det has benefits, but I'm not spending as much time thinking about my trades. Maybe that's actually a good thing.

Let's talk about booking BKNG. What do they do? The high looked like back in July was $5,839, and it's now $4,140. Wow, what a big money decline! Maybe not a big percentage, but that's a lot of money.

Let's talk about it. I'm gonna look at the options pricing. 

---

## User (22:50)

So I'm seeing:
- IVR at 68.4
- IV percentile at 95
- Implied volatility 47
- Historic volatility 45
As an example, if I did the 17 July 20 26 long the 4450 and short the 4500, it's a $23.55 debit. If I bought this and held it to the April options expiration on the 17th, as an example, and it goes to $4,500, it's approximately a six. Max profit at expiration if it's above 4,500 looks to be around a $25,2600 profit at expiration, so it's like a one-to-one ratio, risk to reward. 

---

## User (22:50)

IV percentile seems so high. When would I have to wait for it to go down if it ever goes down now? Well, I should say I shouldn't say ever. 

---

## User (22:59)

I'd have to buy up all my options buying power, cause Thinkorswim is showing the margin required is $10,000, but I could sell the 20 February 26 3720/3620 bull put spread for credit of $570. That's a three-day trade. I really don't think bookings is going to go down to 3720. I think that's a 10 delta.

## User (23:02)

Yeah, you're right. It doesn't make sense with the current situation I'm in, and a 90% chance of a win doesn't seem like gambling, but it is.  

---

## Claude (23:02)

Let me think through this with you honestly.

**The math:**
- Credit: $570
- Spread width: $100 ($10,000)
- Max risk: $9,430
- Risk/reward: **16.5:1 against** ($9,430 risk for $570 gain)
- Short strike $3,720 is $417 below current = 10% drop needed to threaten you
- 10 delta = ~90% probability of profit
- Expires Friday — 3 days, earnings tomorrow after close

**What works in your favor:**
- IV crush helps you — you sold rich premium, it deflates Wednesday morning
- $3,720 is about 2.4 standard deviations below current price
- Even a bad BKNG report historically doesn't usually move 10%+
- 90% win rate is real

**What concerns me:**
- It uses **ALL your buying power** — you said $10,000 margin and it takes it all
- You're cash-negative $93 already
- Earnings are a binary gap event — if BKNG misses badly, the stock gaps at the open and you can't manage the trade while it's happening after hours
- If this goes wrong, $9,430 loss on an account that's already strained
- The 90/10 math means this works 9 out of 10 times — but the one time it doesn't, it wipes out 16 winning trades

**The Rashad rule applies here:** He sells premium, but he does it with defined risk that doesn't max out buying power, and he closes at 50% profit.

If you do this, **close Wednesday morning** after the IV crush gives you an easy 30-50% of max profit. Don't hold to Friday hoping for the last $200. Grab the crush and get out.

But I wouldn't risk the full buying power on one earnings play. Is there a tighter spread — maybe $3,720/$3,670 ($50 wide) for half the credit but half the margin?

## User (23:03)

Make sure this goes in the knowledge base so we can talk about it again. 

---

## User (23:04)

So give me the list of things that we need to talk about or I need to look at soon, just from today, yesterday, maybe back to Sunday. What are the tickers that we've been talking about? 

---

## Claude (23:04)

Here's your active radar from the last few days:

**EARNINGS THIS WEEK:**
- **BKNG** — Reports tomorrow (Feb 18) after close. Wait for IV crush, evaluate Wednesday.
- **MKSI** — Reports tonight/tomorrow. Earnings call Feb 18 at 8:30 AM ET. You had a research deep dive on this.
- **NVIDIA (NVDA)** — Reports Feb 25 after close. You have a TQQQ Jun18 $60C that's tied to this. Reassess after results.

**POSITIONS NEEDING DECISIONS:**
- **TROW** ($93.85) — Down $4K. Thesis fits value rotation but cash-negative account can't support it. Decide: close to recover time value, or hold with $88 hard stop knowing a pullback could stop you out first.
- **ADBE** ($260.48) — Bear put spread, breakeven $227.92. 59 DTE. Heading right direction. Hold.
- **TSLL** — CC open ($20 strike Mar 27). Stock around $15.80, deep underwater on shares.

**NEW WATCHLIST (from BofA/Barclays/Visser reports today):**

| Ticker | Price | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **IEF** | $97.20 | Steepening trade — every source confirms. Cheapest entry on the list. |
| **OXY** | $45.96 | BofA options screen + Visser scarcity. Cheap IV, high EPS. Accessible price. |
| **EQT** | $57.67 | Same as OXY. Nat gas — you already trade nat gas futures. |
| **CEG** | $303.07 | Nuclear/power. AI capex beneficiary. |
| **NEM** | $122.27 | Gold miner. Gold most crowded trade, $6,200 target. |
| **SO** | $92.01 | Utility. Defensive + power demand. |
| **CVX** | $180.61 | Visser named specifically. Energy supermajor. |
| **ETN** | $391.50 | Visser named specifically. Power infrastructure. |
| **EWZ** | $37.76 | Brazil ETF. EM rotation highest since Feb '21. |
| **BKNG** | $4,137 | AI fear overdone per BofA. Post-earnings entry only. |
| **CDNS** | $283.40 | AI enabler not disruptor. 80% recurring revenue. |
| **DASH** | $162.46 | AI fear overdone per BofA. |
| **CRM** | $184.28 | Sell premium only — structural SaaS bear like ADBE. |

**THIS WEEK'S CATALYSTS:**
- **Tue Feb 18:** BKNG earnings, MKSI earnings call 8:30 AM
- **Wed Feb 19:** FOMC minutes, Systematic Theology 7 PM at Todd's
- **Thu Feb 20:** Health insurance enrollment deadline (Becky Otteman)
- **Fri Feb 21:** GDP, PCE data, IEEPA Supreme Court decision, Petree Road tax $100
- **Tue Feb 25:** NVIDIA earnings after close
- **Wed Feb 26:** 22V Research Zoom call with Visser 2:30 PM ET

**KEY THEME:** BofA FMS sell signal at 9.5 = expect a pullback. Don't rush into new positions. Wait for the dip, then enter the scarcity/value names (OXY, EQT, IEF) when they're cheaper.

Now seriously — bed. Good night.

I know you can keyword search in the knowledge base. What about just pulling stuff from time-based?

---

## User (23:07)

Yeah, that's important because I could tell you, 'Hey, in June I could say, "Hey, what were we talking about in February?"' and look back and see how some of those did, whether they would have been good or bad. 

---

## Claude (23:07)

Committed and pushed. KB search now has time-based filtering. Good night, Norm — MKSI earnings call at 8:30 AM, BKNG after close. Productive night.
