- **Visser "Supersonic Tsunami Hits SaaS"** — Full transcript + screenshot analysis. Turbulence model: 12-15 green bars in 5 weeks (covariance matrix shocks while SPX above 50-day, VIX <25). Trade: long scarcity, short abundance. SaaS dying from supply explosion. Hyperscaler trap. Credit weakening.

- **TSLL CC sold:** STO -1 Mar27 $20C @ $0.60. Adjusted cost basis analysis: $18.51 after $159 total CC premium
- **AMZU CC decision: HOLD.** IVR 31 (too low to sell premium), IV=HV (no fear premium), stock dropped precipitously — wait for bounce to sell into strength
