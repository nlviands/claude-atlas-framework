The hooks are configured and the logger is built. Here's what's in place:

**What it does:**
- `UserPromptSubmit` hook fires when you send a message — logs your prompt with timestamp
- `Stop` hook fires when I finish responding — reads Claude's transcript JSONL, extracts my response, logs it

**Output:** `memory/transcripts/2026-02-06.md` (daily files)

**One catch:** The hooks won't take effect until the next session start — Claude Code reads settings on launch. So this conversation won't be auto-logged, but every session after this will be.

Want me to test the Stop hook parsing against an actual Claude transcript file to make sure it extracts responses correctly? That's the trickier part — the JSONL format needs to match what Claude Code actually produces.

Make a note for a new project. John asked me about enabling AI agent to see pictures and be able to learn about them. So the specifics are: Every day the foremen have to fill out paperwork and take pictures of the job progress at the job. So these pictures would be up in the ceiling many times or on the walls. In the walls to see conduit and make sure that conduit is strapped. Make sure lighting whips are strapped.

So you or an AI agent and John would be going through pictures with John explaining what the picture is, and we would want the agent or agents to learn what is code. When looking at a picture: Is it strapped properly? Are all wires terminated? Are the electrical boxes and the ceiling have covers? That kind of thing. 

What we want to know is, is that possible? Can an AI agent be trained to recognize proper electrical work done to code?

oh, I kinda got myself in trouble.  I another claude session I use /memory. The memory.md file is now open in what? vim editor? How do I get out without saving changes?

Saved as a new project with 5 tasks. The fastest way to validate this is task #26 — have John send a few job site photos and we'll run them through Claude's vision right here to see what it catches without any training. That'll tell us immediately how much work the context/reference library needs.

I hit 'q' and a q appears bottom right of screen

Hit `Escape` first, then type `:q!`

The escape key makes sure you're in command mode before entering the quit command.
