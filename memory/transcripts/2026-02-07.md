Save whatever you need to the memory before it shuts you down. 

---

## User (22:54)

Hey, let's figure out why I can't do Substack or Slack on my iPad. I mean, I can do it a little bit, but it's slow, and sometimes it doesn't load and errors out. I would suspect it's because of Ad Guard. What can we do? 

---

## User (22:57)

Yeah, if you can hit the API and pull the blog queries, then do it. I got my iPad with me, I think I've already identified it as 192.168.1.227, but I'm going to rename it in Unifi OS so it's a little bit more identifiable than just iPad. I think Emily has an iPad too.

---

## User (22:58)

Although you couldn't get to AdGuard last time you tried, 

---

## User (22:58)

---

## User (23:00)

I don't know, on the browser it just seems to automatically sign in. 

---

## User (23:02)

I'm using Chrome, and the password is not saved in Chrome.

---

## User (23:05)

Isn't custom filtering filtering out those and not allowing them

---

## Claude (23:05)



Good catch — the `@@` prefix is AdGuard's allowlist syntax. It means "**exception rule — do NOT block this**." So:

- `||slack.com^` = block slack.com
- `@@||slack.com^` = **allow** slack.com (override any blocklist)

The `@@` at the start is what makes it an allowlist rule. So pasting those into Custom filtering rules will **unblock** those domains, not block them.

Go ahead and paste them in — it'll do the right thing.

---

## User (23:06)

 Went from slow and erroring to working now.

---

## Claude (23:06)



Good catch — the `@@` prefix is AdGuard's allowlist syntax. It means "**exception rule — do NOT block this**." So:

- `||slack.com^` = block slack.com
- `@@||slack.com^` = **allow** slack.com (override any blocklist)

The `@@` at the start is what makes it an allowlist rule. So pasting those into Custom filtering rules will **unblock** those domains, not block them.

Go ahead and paste them in — it'll do the right thing.

---

## User (23:06)

What about fixing Substack?

---

## User (23:06)

I'm sorry, not Substack. Slack.

---

## Claude (23:06)

So Slack is working but Substack is still broken? The rules we added might not cover all the domains Substack needs. They use a bunch of CDN and media domains.

Can you open AdGuard in Chrome, go to **Query Log**, filter by `192.168.1.227`, then try loading Substack on your iPad? Tell me which domains show as blocked (red) — I'll give you the exact allowlist rules to add.

Common ones we might be missing:

```
@@||substackapi.com^
@@||substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com^
@@||cdn.substack.com^
@@||newsletter.substack.com^
@@||bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com^
```

But the query log will tell us exactly what's getting killed rather than guessing.

---

## User (23:07)

No, you gave me Substack. I'm sorry, I'm not reading very well, maybe I'm tired. Let me try Slack. Also, Substack is working great.

---

## Claude (23:07)



Wait — so Slack is still having issues too? You said it went from slow/erroring to working. Is it partially working but still choppy, or did it break again?

Either way, same approach — open the **Query Log** in AdGuard, filter by `192.168.1.227`, then use Slack on your iPad. Look for any blocked (red) domains and tell me what they are. Slack uses a ton of subdomains and the blocklists might be catching some we didn't cover.

---

## User (23:08)

Was it you or the other Claude that I had you note to do a project on NFTs? Jordy Visser has been writing about them. Sounds like they may be important as we move forward as a way to identify or identify ourselves. NFTs would prove that you were someplace. He wrote an article about the crisis of identity, and apparently NFTs in a way will give us back our identity.

---

## User (23:10)

Proof that you're part of a community. You know, back in the day, people's names were what they did right there, their jobs, what they did was their identity. Now, you know, we got identity - doctor, lawyer, engineer, electrician, plumber - and with AI, we're losing some of that. But what we can identify ourselves with is, "I was there," you know, like an event or, "I'm part of this community," and so somehow NFTs are going to be able to do that. You know, most people just think of them as crypto-art, but apparently they are much more than that. What's your take? 

---

## User (23:13)

Yeah, log it in. If you would, do a little research right now. It's worth a few agents. I'd be interested in your take on how we could make some money with it.So, that's kind of you know, besides an overall research to get me updated up to date on it, also you know, how could I, as a fairly intelligent ex-developer, tech geek, and love of learning, find a niche somewhere where I could make some money.

# NFTs as Identity and Community Infrastructure: Research Summary (2025-2026)

## 1. Jordi Visser's "Synthetic Reality Crisis" Thesis

Jordi Visser -- former Wall Street macro strategist, founder of Visser-Labs, and 30+ year finance veteran -- published his key piece on this topic on February 3, 2026: **"The Synthetic Reality Crisis: Why AI Is Forcing NFTs to Become Identity Infrastructure"** on his [Substack (visserlabs.substack.com)](https://visserlabs.substack.com/p/the-synthetic-reality-crisis-why).

### The Dual Crisis Framework

Visser identifies two simultaneous crises created by AI:

**Crisis of Truth:** Generative AI has "severed the relationship between digital representation and physical reality." Synthetic media (deepfakes, AI-generated images, text, audio) collapses trust in digital evidence. You can no longer trust that what you see, hear, or read is real.

**Crisis of Purpose (Identity):** When AI outperforms humans at cognitive work, professional identity collapses. The question "What do you do?" no longer answers "Who are you?" The identity people constructed around expertise -- doctor, analyst, writer, trader -- gets demolished when algorithms outperform them. The damage is not just economic; it is psychological.

Together, these create what Visser calls an **"epistemic and identity vacuum"** -- people lose both the ability to verify reality AND the occupational identity that defined them.

### The Identity Migration Pattern

Visser traces a historical arc:
- **Pre-industrial:** Identity = occupation (surnames literally encoded jobs: Smith, Cooper, Baker)
- **Industrial/consumer era:** Identity = consumer status, wealth class, brand affiliation
- **AI era (now):** Identity must migrate to **experiential authenticity** -- because AI makes material goods, credentials, and knowledge work infinitely reproducible, the only remaining scarcity is **verified presence and endurance through time**

### NFTs as the Verification Layer

Visser reframes NFTs not as collectibles or speculative art, but as **"immutable witness statements"** that provide four types of proof:

1. **Proof of Presence** -- physical attendance verification (you were there)
2. **Proof of Participation** -- experience completion (you did the work)
3. **Proof of Belonging** -- earned community membership (you are one of us)
4. **Proof of Witness** -- historical moment anchoring (you saw it happen)

His core formulation: **"In a synthetic reality, verification becomes identity."**

NFTs are, in Visser's words, "sovereignty -- the ability to prove, without permission: I was there. I endured. I belong."

### The Adoption Model

Visser draws an analogy to the early internet: the internet spread through functional tools (email, e-commerce), not through people understanding TCP/IP. Similarly, NFTs will spread through everyday utility -- **access credentials, participation proofs, community passports** -- driven by genuine need, not speculation. The speculative art phase was a false start; the identity use case is the real application.

### Supporting Examples He Uses

- **Damien Hirst's "The Currency" (2021):** Collectors had to choose between the physical painting or the digital NFT -- a forced decision about what form of proof endures. Demonstrated that "belief preceded validation."
- **Sports fandom:** Fan identity is built through decades of "shared suffering." AI cannot replicate temporal commitment. This is the model for how NFT-based identity works -- it accumulates over time and cannot be bought retroactively.

### Related Visser Pieces

His [Substack archive](https://visserlabs.substack.com/archive) shows a consistent thread on these themes:
- "The Fracturing Trust in Capitalism: AI, Automation, and the Inevitable Rise of Bitcoin" (Jan 7, 2026)
- "The Architect of Constraints: Why Context Engineering Is the Human Skill That Matters" (Jan 21, 2026)
- "The Machine Economy: Why AI Agents Need New Money" (Jan 15, 2026)
- "HRV: The Adaptive Metric for Happiness in the Age of AI" (Jan 11, 2026) -- explicitly about finding purpose amid AI change

## 2. Current NFT Identity/Credential Projects

### Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)

Introduced formally by Vitalik Buterin in the May 2022 whitepaper **"Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul."** SBTs are non-transferable NFTs -- they use modified smart contracts that block the transfer function. They can be minted by authorized issuers and optionally burned (revoked), but **cannot be sold or moved between wallets**.

**Current state (2025-2026):**
- Conceptually mature, but adoption is still early-stage and sector-specific
- Real implementations: [Otterspace](https://www.otterspace.xyz/) (DAO governance badges using ERC-4973), [Masa](https://www.masa.finance/) (Web3 digital passport), and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (employee career credentials)
- Academic credentials: IE University has issued NFT diplomas since 2022
- Healthcare sector applications are being researched ([ACM published a case study](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3674155))
- Critical unsolved problem: **key recovery** -- if you lose your wallet private key, you lose your entire on-chain identity, including irreplaceable credentials

### POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol)

Established in 2019. Issues NFTs as digital badges proving attendance at specific events.

**Current state:**
- Over **30 million POAPs minted** to date
- $10 million funding round completed in 2022
- Used by: Warner Music Group, US Open, Lollapalooza, Adidas, Coinbase, Sotheby's
- Also used in virtual environments (Decentraland events)
- **Weakness:** POAPs are transferable and farmable -- people collect and sell them, undermining the "proof of attendance" value proposition. This is precisely why soulbound variants are needed.

Sources: [OpenSea POAP Guide](https://opensea.io/learn/nft/what-is-poap), [Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/proof-of-attendance-protocol-poap)

### Decentralized Identity (DID) Standards

**W3C published Verifiable Credentials 2.0 as a formal W3C Standard in May 2025** -- a major milestone. The standard provides a universal framework for structuring, issuing, and verifying credentials.

Key DID methods in use:
- `did:key` -- simple, no blockchain required
- `did:ion` -- built on Bitcoin, emphasizes decentralization and scalability
- `did:web` -- uses traditional DNS infrastructure, simpler but less decentralized
- KERI -- emerging alternative

Source: [W3C Press Release](https://www.w3.org/press-releases/2025/verifiable-credentials-2-0/)

### Token Gating

Token-gated access is the most commercially mature NFT-identity use case. Smart contracts check whether a required token is present in a connected wallet, then unlock content, pricing, or access.

**Current commercial adoption:**
- [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/blog/token-gating) has native token-gating support for retailers
- Doodles launched "Doodlestv" -- a token-gated media platform
- Proof Collective (Moonbirds) gates membership access
- Brands report **28% higher repeat customer interactions** and **12% lower acquisition costs** vs. traditional loyalty
- NFT market valued at $3.6B in 2024, projected $22.8B by 2034

### Proof of Personhood / Sybil Resistance

**Human Passport (formerly Gitcoin Passport):**
- Gitcoin Passport was [acquired by Holonym Foundation](https://chainwire.org/2025/02/10/holonym-foundation-acquires-gitcoin-passport-to-onboard-its-2m-users-to-create-worlds-largest-proof-of-humanity-solution/) in February 2025 and rebranded to [Human Passport (human.tech)](https://passport.human.tech/)
- **2M+ users, 34M+ credentials issued**
- Protected over **$430M in airdrop and grant funds** from Sybil attacks
- 110+ partner ecosystems
- Uses aggregated "stamps" from multiple identity providers (Guild, Civic, BrightID, ENS, etc.), weighted by cost of forgery
- Generates **3x more identity proofs** than Worldcoin

**Worldcoin / World ID:**
- Founded by Sam Altman; uses iris-scanning "Orb" hardware for biometric verification
- **12 million unique individuals verified** across 160 countries, 75 million transactions
- Well below its 50M target by end of 2025
- Partnerships with Razer (gaming identity) and Match Group (dating profile verification)
- **Major regulatory headwinds:** investigations or bans in Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Kenya, Portugal, Spain, South Korea
- Mobile-sized Orb planned for 2026

## 3. Dominant Blockchains for Identity Use Cases

| Chain | Role in Identity | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **Ethereum** | Foundation layer. ENS, SBTs, most DID standards. | 2M+ ENS names registered. ENSv2 migrating to L2 (Namechain) in 2026 for lower gas. Still the trust anchor for high-value credentials. |
| **Polygon** | Primary chain for scalable identity apps. | Lens Protocol (social identity NFTs) built here. Polygon ID uses ZK proofs for privacy-preserving credential verification. Low fees make it practical for mass issuance. |
| **Base (Coinbase L2)** | Rising fast. 13.94% ecosystem mindshare in 2025. | Coinbase's on-ramp advantage. Growing for consumer identity applications. |
| **Solana** | Largest overall NFT ecosystem (26.79% mindshare). | Strong for consumer/event NFTs. Firedancer upgrade positioning it for 2026 infrastructure use. Less established for DID/credential standards. |
| **Bitcoin (via did:ion)** | DID anchoring layer. | Microsoft's ION network uses Bitcoin for decentralized identifier resolution. Not for NFTs directly, but critical for DID infrastructure. |

**Bottom line:** Ethereum remains the trust/standards layer, Polygon is the scalable execution layer for identity apps, and Base is the fast-growing consumer layer. Solana dominates NFT volume but is less established for formal identity/credential standards.

## 4. Adoption Curve: Real or Theoretical?

**The honest answer: it is a mixed picture. Some segments are in production; others remain theoretical.**

### Already in production and used at scale:
- **ENS:** 2M+ registered names, integrated across major wallets and exchanges. Nike, Reddit, Snoop Dogg all have .eth names. ENSv2 with L2 migration coming 2026.
- **Human Passport (ex-Gitcoin Passport):** 2M users, $430M protected, 110 partners. This is real, working infrastructure.
- **POAPs:** 30M+ minted. Used by Warner Music, US Open, Coinbase, Adidas. Real but largely crypto-native audiences.
- **Token gating:** Shopify has native support. Brands see measurable ROI (28% higher repeat interactions). Most commercially mature use case.
- **World ID:** 12M verified humans. Partnerships with Razer and Match Group. Real but facing regulatory resistance in multiple countries.

### In active development with regulatory mandates:
- **EU Digital Identity Wallets (eIDAS 2.0):** Every EU member state **must** offer a digital identity wallet by **end of 2026**. This is law, not speculation. Uses W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0 (published as standard May 2025). This will be the largest government-mandated digital identity rollout in history, affecting hundreds of millions of people.
- **Microsoft Entra Verified ID:** Enterprise decentralized identity using W3C standards. In production.

### Still early/theoretical:
- **Soulbound tokens for mainstream credentials:** Limited real-world issuers. Key recovery problem unsolved. Conceptually compelling but not widely deployed outside crypto-native contexts.
- **On-chain professional reputation systems:** Masa, Arcx credit scores -- interesting but small user bases.
- **Cross-chain identity portability:** Standards exist (W3C DIDs) but interoperability is fragile in practice.

## Summary Assessment

**Visser's thesis is directionally correct and well-timed.** The convergence of three forces makes NFT-as-identity increasingly inevitable:

1. **AI is creating a verification crisis** -- deepfakes, synthetic content, and AI-generated credentials mean "proof that something is real" becomes the scarce resource. Visser nails this.

2. **Regulatory tailwinds are real** -- the EU mandating digital identity wallets for 450M+ people by end of 2026, built on W3C Verifiable Credentials, creates massive infrastructure demand. This is the biggest signal that this is not theoretical.

3. **The speculative NFT market collapse was clarifying** -- it killed the "NFTs as art speculation" narrative and left behind the utility use cases (credentials, access, identity) that actually have product-market fit.

**Where Visser may be early:** The bridge from crypto-native adoption (Galxe, POAPs, ENS) to mainstream consumer identity is still under construction. Token gating via Shopify is the closest thing to mainstream, but most people still do not have crypto wallets. The EU wallet mandate could be the forcing function that changes this -- but that is a 2026-2027 story, not today.

**The key tension:** Blockchain-native identity (ENS, SBTs, POAPs) vs. government-mandated digital identity (eIDAS wallets) are developing on parallel tracks. Whether they converge or compete will determine the shape of digital identity for the next decade.</result>

# Technical Research: Building NFT Identity/Community Systems (2025-2026)

## 1. Tools, Frameworks, and Standards

### Smart Contract Standards

The EVM ecosystem has several finalized standards relevant to NFT identity:

- **[ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)** -- The foundational NFT standard. One token = one unique identity. Best for membership cards, credentials, event passes. Every wallet and marketplace supports it natively.

- **[ERC-1155](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/)** -- Multi-token standard. A single contract can issue fungible tokens (points, credits) AND non-fungible tokens (membership badges) simultaneously. More gas-efficient for batch operations. Good for systems that need both membership NFTs and reward tokens.

- **[ERC-5192](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5192)** -- Minimal Soulbound NFT extension. Adds a `locked()` function to ERC-721 that makes tokens non-transferable. This is the key standard for identity -- you don't want people selling their membership credentials. Simple to implement: it's just a modifier on top of ERC-721.

- **[ERC-4337](https://docs.erc4337.io/index.html)** -- Account Abstraction. Not an NFT standard per se, but critical for UX. Enables "smart wallets" that support gasless transactions, social recovery, and familiar login flows. Over 40 million smart accounts deployed as of 2025. This is what makes NFT identity viable for non-crypto-native users -- they never need to buy ETH or understand gas.

- **ERC-5114 / ERC-5484** -- Alternative soulbound approaches. ERC-5114 binds tokens to other tokens (not accounts). ERC-5484 adds "burn authorization" so an issuer can revoke credentials. Useful for credentialing systems where you need revocation.

### Competing Approach: Attestations

Worth noting that [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://www.chainscorelabs.com/en/comparisons/identity-soulbound-vs-verifiable-credentials/on-chain-attestation-standards/eas-vs-sbt-standards-erc-721-5192) is an alternative to soulbound NFTs for identity. Attestations on Optimism cost under $0.01 and are more gas-efficient. However, SBTs have better wallet visibility and composability with existing NFT infrastructure. The tradeoff is: attestations are cheaper and more flexible, SBTs are more visible and user-friendly.

### No-Code / Low-Code Platforms

Several platforms let you deploy NFT membership systems without writing Solidity:

- **[thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/)** -- The most mature option. Offers pre-built `DropERC721` contracts deployable in one click via their dashboard. Supports claim conditions (allowlists, release dates, price tiers, per-wallet limits). Free to use -- you only pay gas. Has a full SDK (TypeScript, React, Python, Unity, Go) plus a no-code dashboard. Templates for NFT claim pages exist out of the box.

- **[NFTs2Me](https://nfts2me.com/)** -- Fully no-code. Deploy NFT projects across EVM-compatible chains (including testnets) in minutes. Good for rapid prototyping.

- **[Shopify Token Gating](https://www.shopify.com/blog/token-gating)** -- For retail/commerce use cases. Built-in NFT token gating for storefronts. Checks wallet ownership and unlocks exclusive products, prices, or content.

- **[Kaleido](https://www.kaleido.io/blockchain-blog/nft-based-memberships-for-business)** -- Enterprise-grade. NFT-based membership platform with tracking, rewards, and engagement features built in.

### APIs and SDKs

- **[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)** -- Node infrastructure + NFT API. Can find, verify, and display any NFT across major blockchains. Free tier available. Their NFT API is the most reliable for reading ownership data.

- **[Moralis](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/alchemy-vs-moralis)** -- Competing web3 API. NFT balance, metadata, transfers, and ownership data on a single platform. Slightly easier developer onboarding than Alchemy.

- **[QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/nfts/how-to-create-and-deploy-an-erc-721-nft)** -- Node provider with NFT-specific guides and tools. Free tier for testnets.

- **[OpenZeppelin](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/)** -- Not an API, but the de facto smart contract library. Their Wizard tool lets you configure ERC-721 contracts with features (mintable, burnable, soulbound, enumerable) and generates audited Solidity code.

---

## 2. How Hard Is It to Build?

### What a Minimum Viable Product Looks Like

A basic NFT membership/identity system has four components:

1. **Smart contract** -- ERC-721 with soulbound modifier (ERC-5192). Mints a non-transferable NFT to a wallet address. ~50-100 lines of Solidity, or zero lines if using thirdweb's pre-built contracts.

2. **Minting interface** -- A web page where users connect a wallet and claim/receive their membership NFT. Thirdweb provides a [template for this](https://thirdweb.com/templates/nft-claim-page) that works out of the box.

3. **Verification layer** -- Something that checks "does this wallet hold the membership NFT?" before granting access. This is where Collab.Land (Discord), Guild.xyz, or a custom API call using Alchemy's NFT API comes in.

4. **Access control** -- The actual gate. A Discord role, a webpage, a Telegram group, event entry, etc.

### What an Ex-Developer Needs to Learn

The answer depends heavily on which path you take:

**Path A: No-Code (fastest, no Solidity needed)**
- Learn: Wallet concepts (MetaMask, connecting wallets), basic blockchain terminology (gas, chains, testnets), thirdweb dashboard
- Skip: Solidity, Hardhat, smart contract testing
- Timeline: A working prototype in a weekend is realistic
- Limitation: Less customization, tied to platform capabilities

**Path B: Low-Code with SDKs (moderate)**
- Learn: thirdweb or Alchemy SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript), basic React for a frontend, wallet connection libraries (wagmi, RainbowKit)
- Solidity optional: Use pre-built contracts, customize with SDK calls
- Timeline: Weekend prototype if you know JavaScript. 1-2 weeks if rusty.

**Path C: Full Custom (maximum control)**
- Learn: Solidity (the language is simple -- similar to JavaScript -- the security mindset is the hard part), Hardhat or Foundry (development frameworks), OpenZeppelin contracts, testing with ethers.js
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks to a testnet prototype with confidence. The contract itself is fast; testing and security review take time.
- When to choose this: Only if you need custom logic that pre-built contracts don't support (custom royalty splits, complex access rules, multi-tier membership with on-chain logic).

**Bottom line:** An ex-developer who knows JavaScript could absolutely build a working prototype in a weekend using thirdweb's no-code dashboard + their SDK for a custom claim page, deployed to a testnet. The "hard" part of Web3 development (security audits, mainnet gas optimization, edge cases) only matters when you go to production.

### Weekend Prototype Plan

1. Install MetaMask, switch to Sepolia testnet, get free test ETH from a [faucet](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/nfts/how-to-create-and-deploy-an-erc-721-nft)
2. Go to thirdweb dashboard, deploy a DropERC721 contract to Sepolia (one click, zero code)
3. Configure claim conditions (open mint, or allowlist only)
4. Use thirdweb's NFT claim page template to create a minting frontend
5. Add Collab.Land or Guild.xyz bot to a Discord server, point it at your contract
6. Test: mint NFT in wallet, verify Discord role assignment works
7. Total cost: $0 (testnet gas is free)

---

## 3. Cost Structure

### Gas Fees by Chain (2025-2026 data)

| Chain | NFT Mint Cost | Contract Deploy Cost | Notes |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Ethereum L1** | $10-$80+ | $50-$300+ | Varies wildly with congestion. Fusaka upgrade (Nov 2025) aims to cut fees 70%. Still expensive for consumer apps. |
| **Polygon** | ~$0.002 | ~$0.01-$0.05 | Extremely cheap. Good ecosystem. Mature tooling. |
| **Base** | ~$0.01-$0.05 | ~$0.10-$0.50 | Coinbase's L2. Growing fast. Good brand for mainstream adoption. |
| **Arbitrum** | ~$0.05 | ~$0.50-$2.00 | Solid L2, good DeFi ecosystem. |
| **Solana** | ~$0.005 | ~$0.01-$0.10 | Very cheap but different programming model (Rust, not Solidity). Different toolchain entirely. |
| **BNB Chain** | ~$0.50 | ~$1-$5 | Moderate cost. Large user base in Asia. |

### Infrastructure Costs

- **Node provider (Alchemy/QuickNode/Moralis):** Free tier covers prototyping and low-volume production. Paid plans start at ~$49-$99/month for higher throughput.
- **IPFS storage (metadata/images):** Free via Pinata (1GB free) or thirdweb's built-in storage. Production: ~$20/month for moderate usage.
- **Frontend hosting:** Standard web hosting. Vercel free tier works fine.
- **thirdweb:** Free. No platform fees. You only pay gas.
- **Domain/SSL:** Standard web costs ($10-$20/year).

### Cheapest Prototyping Path

Total cost to prototype: **$0**

- Deploy to Sepolia or Mumbai testnet (free gas from faucets)
- Use thirdweb or NFTs2Me (no platform fees)
- Host on Vercel free tier
- Use Alchemy free tier for API calls

Total cost to go to production on Polygon or Base: **Under $5 for contract deployment + first 100 mints**. Ongoing costs are near-zero unless you're processing thousands of transactions per day.

## 4. Integration Points

### Discord and Telegram

This is the most mature integration path:

- **[Collab.Land](https://collab.land/)** -- The market leader. 6.5+ million verified wallets. Bot checks wallet for NFT ownership, assigns Discord/Telegram roles automatically. Supports ERC-721, ERC-1155, and custom contract checks. Setup takes ~15 minutes via their Command Center.

- **[Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/)** -- More flexible than Collab.Land. Supports composable requirements with logical operators (AND, OR, NOR, NAND) across multiple chains. Integrated with Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Google Workspace, GitHub, and Steam. Can issue soulbound reward tokens. Supports "platformless memberships" where one credential unlocks multiple platforms.

### Slack

Slack integration is notably weaker than Discord. Neither Collab.Land nor Guild.xyz natively support Slack. Options:
- Build a custom Slack bot that queries the blockchain via Alchemy/Moralis NFT API
- Use [miniOrange](https://www.miniorange.com/web3/nft-based-gated-content/discord-token-gating-setup-guide) which offers broader token-gating capabilities
- Custom middleware is the realistic path here

### Event Platforms

- **Eventbrite:** [NFT.Kred](https://www.nft.nyc/blog/nft-ticketing-experiments-and-solutions-for-your-event) has a direct integration that issues NFT tickets on Eventbrite registration. Proven at NFT.NYC.
- **POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol):** Free NFT badges for event attendance. Widely used at conferences. Integrates with [Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/) for post-event access gating ("attended this event = unlock this Discord channel").
- **Luma:** No native NFT integration found in research. Would require custom webhook integration (Luma supports webhooks on registration events).
- **Dedicated NFT ticketing platforms:** [Seatlab](https://seatlab.com/nft-ticketing/), [Ticket Fairy](https://www.ticketfairy.com/event-ticketing/nft-gated-ticketing/), YellowHeart, TicketMint. These are purpose-built alternatives to Eventbrite with NFT native.

### Existing Auth Systems (OAuth, SAML)

This is surprisingly well-solved:

- **[Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE)](https://docs.login.xyz/)** -- EIP-4361 standard. Works like "Sign in with Google" but uses a wallet signature. The user signs a message with their wallet, and your backend verifies it.
- **[Auth0 SIWE Integration](https://auth0.com/blog/sign-in-with-ethereum-siwe-now-available-on-auth0/)** -- Spruce released a marketplace integration. You can add SIWE to any Auth0 tenant, which means any app using Auth0 for OAuth/OpenID Connect can add wallet-based login with configuration only (no code changes to your auth flow).
- **[Authgear](https://docs.authgear.com/how-to-guide/authenticate/web3)** -- Auth platform that adds NFT ownership data to user profiles. After wallet login, it checks NFT balances and exposes that in user info.
- **[Better Auth SIWE Plugin](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/siwe)** -- Open-source auth library with built-in SIWE support.

The pattern is: User signs in with wallet (SIWE) -> backend verifies signature -> backend checks NFT ownership via Alchemy API -> grants/denies access. This fits cleanly into existing OAuth/OIDC flows.

### Physical Access (NFC, QR Codes)

- **QR Codes:** The standard approach for events. User connects wallet on a verification page, system confirms NFT ownership, generates a time-limited QR code. Door staff scan with an app. [Dynamic QR codes](https://www.qrcode-tiger.com/nft-ticketing) that expire every few seconds prevent screenshot sharing.
- **NFC:** [Seatlab](https://seatlab.com/nft-ticketing/) attaches NFC tags to NFT tickets via smart contract. When the NFT transfers, the NFC authorization transfers with it. Works with Apple Wallet and Google Wallet. More secure than QR (can't screenshot an NFC tap).
- **Hybrid:** Most production systems use QR for entry verification + NFC for premium/VIP experiences. The NFT is the source of truth; QR/NFC are just the verification interfaces.

## 5. Developer Ecosystem and Talent Market

### Market Overview

The Web3 job market is in a paradoxical state as of early 2026:

- **Job growth is real:** [300% surge in openings from 2023-2025](https://medium.com/@Syndika_co/web3-hiring-trends-you-need-to-know-in-2026-ef535b6bbf9c), 47% rebound in 2025 alone. Roughly 8,000-12,000 active positions globally.
- **But it's brutally competitive:** [10,000 applicants for 28 positions](https://crypto.forem.com/kniraj/10000-applicants-28-positions-the-brutal-math-of-web3-hiring-in-2026-58po) is not uncommon. Up to 450 applicants per engineering role.
- **Specialized talent is scarce:** Demand exceeds supply for people who know Solidity + Rust + security. Compliance/regulatory talent is the hardest to hire.
- **Compensation is high:** Blockchain developers in the US average [$146,250/year](https://recruitblock.io/web3-hiring-in-2025-trends-challenges-and-opportunities/). Seniors command $187,000-$200,000. AI + Web3 engineers earn $140,000-$250,000.

### What This Means Practically

- There is NOT a shortage of people who want to work in Web3. There IS a shortage of people with production experience (shipped contracts to mainnet, handled security incidents, worked with audit firms).
- For building an NFT identity system specifically, you don't need deep Solidity expertise if you use thirdweb or similar platforms. The bottleneck is more likely on the product/UX side than the smart contract side.
- If you need to hire a contractor for custom work, expect $100-$200/hour for a competent Solidity developer with audit experience. For a thirdweb-based integration, a general full-stack developer who's done one or two Web3 projects would suffice at standard rates.

### Key Ecosystem Players

The most active frameworks/communities for builders:

| Tool | Purpose | Maturity |
|------|---------|----------|
| [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) | Smart contract dev framework | Very mature, industry standard |
| [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) | Fast smart contract dev (Rust-based) | Growing fast, preferred by advanced devs |
| [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) | Audited contract libraries | Industry standard, battle-tested |
| [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) | Full-stack Web3 dev platform | Mature, best no-code/low-code option |
| [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) | React hooks for Ethereum | Standard for frontend wallet integration |
| [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) | Wallet connection UI | Plug-and-play wallet connect modal |
| [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) | Node infra + APIs | Market leader |

---

## Summary: Practical Assessment

**Can you build this?** Yes. The tooling is mature enough that an ex-developer can have a working testnet prototype in a weekend using no-code tools (thirdweb + Guild.xyz + Discord), at zero cost.

**Should you write Solidity?** Not for an MVP. Use pre-built contracts. Learn Solidity later if you need custom on-chain logic (multi-tier membership, on-chain governance, complex royalty mechanics).

**Which chain?** Base or Polygon for production. Both are cheap (<$0.01/transaction), have strong tooling support, and are Ethereum-compatible (same Solidity contracts work on all three). Base has momentum and Coinbase brand recognition. Polygon has longer track record.

**Biggest technical risk:** Not the blockchain side -- that's commoditized. The risk is in UX. Wallet onboarding is still friction-heavy for non-crypto users. ERC-4337 (account abstraction) helps but adds implementation complexity. The winning NFT identity systems in 2025-2026 are the ones that hide the blockchain entirely from end users.

**What to prototype first:** NFT membership card (soulbound, on testnet) -> Discord token gating via Guild.xyz -> claim page for new members -> iterate on UX from there.</result>

# NFT Identity & Community Space: Practical Money-Making Opportunities (2025-2026)

## The Big Picture First

The NFT market has fundamentally shifted. The speculative PFP/art bubble is dead. What replaced it is **NFTs as software infrastructure** -- membership keys, credentials, access tokens, loyalty systems. This is where the real money is now. The global NFT market is projected at ~$65 billion in 2025 growing to ~$700 billion by 2033, with the utility segment (not art) driving that growth. The event token-gating platform market alone was $1.27 billion in 2024 with 18.9% CAGR projected through 2033.

The honest summary: **this space is real but early.** Most organizations still don't understand how to implement NFT-based identity. That gap between "enterprises want this" and "nobody knows how to set it up" is where the money sits for someone with your profile.

---

## Opportunity 1: Building NFT Community Tools (SaaS / Micro-SaaS)

### What exists now
- **Guild.xyz** -- token-gating across 60+ EVM chains, 1,000+ teams. The dominant player for Discord/Telegram access control.
- **Collab.Land** -- membership verification bot for Discord/Telegram. Established but aging.
- **Galxe** -- 34 million users, quest/loyalty campaigns with NFT rewards. The gorilla in the room.
- **Zealy** -- 700K monthly active users, social coordination and community quests.
- **Mintology** -- APIs for token-gated commerce, content access.
- **Shopify native token gating** -- built-in NFT integration, apps from $10-50/month.

### Where the gaps are
1. **No-code NFT membership creation for non-crypto organizations.** Guild, Collab.Land, and Galxe all assume crypto-native users. Rotary clubs, alumni associations, professional conferences -- they need something that abstracts away wallets entirely. The Starbucks Odyssey program failed precisely because it was too complex with dual currencies and gated quizzes.
2. **Credential issuance for small/mid organizations.** POK is emerging for education but there is no dominant simple platform for "I run a 500-person professional association and want to issue verifiable membership NFTs." Enterprise solutions exist; SMB solutions do not.
3. **Analytics dashboards for NFT-gated communities.** Guild gates access but doesn't tell you who's engaged, who's churning, or what the NFT holders actually do after they get in. Community intelligence tooling is thin.
4. **Cross-platform token gating beyond Discord/Telegram.** Gating for Slack, Notion, Google Workspace, Zoom -- where actual business communities live -- is essentially nonexistent.

### Verdict: REAL but requires significant execution
- **Barrier to entry:** High. 3-6 months to build MVP, requires smart contract knowledge, frontend/backend dev, and understanding of wallet infrastructure. You can code, which is a major advantage, but this is not a weekend project.
- **Revenue model:** SaaS subscription ($29-199/month per community), transaction fees on mints, or white-label licensing to agencies.
- **Honest assessment:** The "no-code NFT membership for normies" angle is the most promising gap. The pure crypto-to-crypto tools space is crowded. Building for organizations that are NOT crypto-native is the underserved market.

---

## Opportunity 2: Consulting / Implementation Services

### What the market looks like
- NFT consulting agencies charge project-based fees, with freelance Web3 developers commanding $100-150/hour. Specialized consultants can earn $150-250K+ annually.
- Fortune 500 companies are projected to have ~50% adoption of NFTs in some form (loyalty, credentials, digital twins) by 2026.
- Brands using NFT-based loyalty report **28% higher repeat customer interactions** and **12% lower acquisition costs** vs. traditional systems.
- Major implementations: Adidas ALTS (20K+ NFTs as membership tokens), Liquid Death Country Club (200K members with Novel Wallet Pass NFTs), various university credential programs.

### What the service offering looks like
You would help organizations:
1. Design their NFT membership/credential strategy (what does the NFT unlock, how does it work)
2. Select and configure the tech stack (Guild.xyz, Shopify integration, custom smart contracts)
3. Deploy and manage the initial rollout
4. Train their team to maintain it

### Target clients
- **Conference organizers** -- POAP-style attendance credentials, VIP access tiers, alumni networks post-event.
- **Professional associations** -- verifiable membership credentials, CE tracking, exclusive member content gating.
- **E-commerce brands** -- token-gated loyalty tiers on Shopify, exclusive drops for holders.
- **Coworking spaces / clubs** -- NFT-based membership cards that are on-chain verifiable and transferable.
- **Universities and training orgs** -- credential issuance (replacing Credly/Accredible with NFT-based certs).

### Verdict: MOST PRACTICAL entry point
- **Barrier to entry:** Low-to-medium. You need to deeply understand 3-4 platforms (Guild.xyz, Shopify token gating, a credential platform like POK, a smart contract deployment tool like thirdweb). No capital required. Build a portfolio with 2-3 free/discounted pilot projects.
- **Revenue model:** Project-based ($5K-25K per implementation depending on complexity), retainer for ongoing management ($1K-3K/month), or hybrid.
- **Honest assessment:** This is the fastest path to revenue for your profile. Most organizations are interested but paralyzed by complexity. Someone who can say "I'll handle the entire NFT membership setup for your conference end-to-end for $8K" is solving a real pain point. The challenge is finding clients -- you need to be where event organizers, association directors, and brand managers are looking for help.

---

## Opportunity 3: Designing & Selling NFT Membership Programs

### What this means in practice
Not selling art. Designing and deploying entire NFT-based membership ecosystems for organizations. You are the architect, not just the implementer.

### Real examples of what organizations are doing
- **Adidas ALTS**: 20K avatar NFTs that double as membership tokens with merch access and event invites.
- **Liquid Death**: 200K-member Country Club with NFTs granting access to limited merch drops, celebrity AMAs, VIP event entry.
- **Universities**: Issuing NFT diplomas and micro-credentials that are verifiable on-chain, replacing legacy providers.

### What you would sell
A complete "membership-in-a-box" package:
1. Strategy document (membership tiers, what each tier unlocks)
2. Smart contract deployment (the actual NFTs)
3. Minting page / claim flow
4. Integration with their existing platforms (website, Discord, email)
5. Ongoing support

### Verdict: REAL but a harder sell
- **Barrier to entry:** Medium. You need to build credibility first -- case studies matter enormously. Start with consulting (Opportunity 2), build 3-5 case studies, then package it as a productized service.
- **Revenue model:** $10K-50K per program design and deployment, plus ongoing maintenance retainer.
- **Honest assessment:** This is the "graduate-level" version of consulting. Higher ticket, fewer clients needed. But you need a track record first. Nobody pays $25K+ for an NFT membership system from someone without proven examples. Do Opportunity 2 first, then evolve into this.

---

## Opportunity 4: Trading & Investment Angles

### Infrastructure tokens in the identity/credential space

**Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**
- Current price: ~$6.06 (down from highs, consensus predictions: $15-18 by end of 2026)
- 910K active domains, 8% month-over-month growth in registrations
- Real utility: human-readable wallet addresses, decentralized naming
- This is the closest thing to a blue-chip in decentralized identity infrastructure

**Worldcoin (WLD)**
- Current price: crashed from ~$12 ATH to ~$0.50 by end of 2025
- 12M verified users, but facing bans/investigations in Spain, Thailand, Germany
- 37M WLD tokens unlock weekly until July 2026, creating constant sell pressure
- **High risk.** Regulatory headwinds are severe. The biometric iris scanning model is controversial.

**Civic (CVC)**
- Current price: $0.05, ranked #453
- Ethereum-based identity verification platform
- Marginal project at this point. Low conviction play.

**Polygon ID / Privado ID**
- Not a standalone token but Polygon (MATIC/POL) benefits from identity infrastructure built on its chain
- ZK-proof-based private credentials gaining institutional traction

**SPACE ID**
- Multi-chain domain name platform
- Smaller cap, higher risk

### Verdict: SPECULATIVE, not a primary strategy
- **Barrier to entry:** Just capital and risk tolerance.
- **Honest assessment:** ENS is the only one I would call a legitimate infrastructure investment with real adoption metrics. WLD is a gamble on regulatory outcomes. The rest are low-conviction. Do NOT make investing in identity tokens your primary income strategy. These are side bets at best. The real alpha in this space comes from building and earning, not from token speculation.

---

## Opportunity 5: Content & Education

### What the market looks like
- Web3 education market projected at $12.9B by 2032 (from $2B in 2024).
- Substack has 35M monthly readers. NFT-focused newsletters like "Edge of NFT" and "nft now" have established audiences of tens of thousands.
- Over 100 NFT courses exist on platforms like Udemy, with prices from free to $200+.
- YouTube web3 content is saturated at the speculative/trading level but thin at the **practical implementation** level.

### Where the real opportunity is
The market is flooded with "how to buy NFTs" and "NFT trading" content. What is **severely lacking** is:
1. **"How to implement NFT membership for your business" -- practical, step-by-step.** Show a small business owner how to set up Shopify token gating. Walk a conference organizer through POAP creation. This content barely exists.
2. **Newsletter covering the identity/credential NFT niche specifically.** The broad NFT newsletters cover everything. Nobody owns the "NFTs for business identity and membership" niche.
3. **Case study breakdowns.** "How Liquid Death's NFT membership works, what it costs, and how to build something similar for 1/100th the price."

### Verdict: REAL but slow to monetize
- **Barrier to entry:** Low. Start a Substack (free), YouTube channel (free), or Twitter/X presence today. Time investment: 5-10 hours/week to produce quality content.
- **Revenue model:** Newsletter sponsorships ($500-2K per issue at 5K+ subscribers), course sales ($97-497 per student), YouTube ad revenue, and critically -- content feeds consulting leads (Opportunity 2).
- **Honest assessment:** Content alone is unlikely to be your primary income in the first 6-12 months. But content is a **force multiplier** for consulting. If you're the person publishing the definitive guide on "how to set up NFT membership for a professional association," clients come to you. The content IS the marketing for the consulting business. Do both in parallel.

---

## Opportunity 6: Barrier-to-Entry Summary

| Opportunity | Time to First $ | Capital Needed | Technical Skill | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SaaS / Tools | 6-12 months | $0-5K (hosting) | High (smart contracts, full-stack) | Medium-High |
| Consulting | 1-3 months | $0 | Medium (platform knowledge) | Low |
| NFT Program Design | 3-6 months | $0 | Medium-High | Low-Medium |
| Token Investing | Immediate | $1K-50K+ | Low | High |
| Content / Education | 3-12 months | $0-500 | Low-Medium | Low |

---

## Opportunity 7: What People Are Actually Paying For Right Now

Based on the research, here is what real money is flowing toward in this space today:

1. **Token-gating implementation for e-commerce** -- Shopify merchants are paying $10-50/month for apps and $5-15K for custom setups. Small but real and growing.

2. **NFT loyalty program design for brands** -- Agencies charge $20-100K+ to design and deploy programs like Liquid Death's. The enterprise market is active.

3. **Credential issuance for education** -- Universities abandoning Credly for NFT-based credentials via POK and similar platforms. Institutions pay for implementation, not the platform itself (many platforms are free/cheap).

4. **Community management with Web3 tooling** -- Web3 community management agencies charge $2-10K/month for Discord/Telegram management with token-gating. Toolkit costs for communities under 10K members run under $500/month.

5. **Quest/loyalty campaign management** -- Projects pay Galxe and Zealy for premium tiers ($500-5K+/month) to run token-incentivized campaigns with Sybil protection and deep analytics.

6. **Web3 consulting hourly rates** -- Freelance developers and consultants in this space bill $100-150/hour. Specialized identity/credential consultants can command more.

---

## Recommended Strategy for Your Profile

Given that you can code but do not want a 9-5 dev job, understand markets, and want to monetize a niche:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Consulting + Content**
- Pick 2-3 platforms and learn them deeply (Guild.xyz, Shopify token gating, thirdweb or POK for credentials).
- Start a focused Substack/Twitter presence on "NFTs for business identity and membership." Publish weekly.
- Do 2-3 pilot projects at reduced rates or free-for-portfolio. Target local conferences, professional associations, or small e-commerce brands.
- Revenue target: $3-8K from first paid clients.

**Phase 2 (Months 3-9): Productized Consulting**
- Package your consulting into fixed-price offerings ("Conference NFT Membership Package: $8K," "Shopify Token-Gating Setup: $3K").
- Use case studies from Phase 1 to sell. Content drives inbound leads.
- Build a small course ($97-297) for DIY implementers.
- Revenue target: $5-15K/month.

**Phase 3 (Months 9-18): Tools or Scale**
- If you see a repeated pain point across clients, build a micro-SaaS tool to solve it.
- OR hire a VA/junior dev and scale the consulting practice.
- Revenue target: $15-30K/month.

**Side bet (ongoing):** Accumulate ENS tokens during dips as a long-term infrastructure bet. Small position size. This is not the core strategy.

## Claude (23:18)

Full report saved to `reports/NFT_Identity_Research_2026-02-07.md`. Here's the summary that matters:

---

## The Money Play — Ranked by "Norm Can Do This"

**#1: Consulting (fastest to cash)**
Help organizations set up NFT membership/credential systems. Conference organizers, professional associations, e-commerce brands on Shopify, clubs. They want this but are paralyzed by complexity. You walk in and say "I'll set up your entire NFT membership system for $8K, end to end." Freelance Web3 consultants bill $100-150/hr. You can code, which puts you ahead of 90% of consultants in this space. **1-3 months to first dollar.**

**#2: Content (the marketing engine)**
Start a Substack covering "NFTs for business identity" — practical implementation, not crypto-bro speculation. This niche is **wide open**. Everyone writes about trading NFTs. Almost nobody writes "how to set up NFT membership for your professional association, step by step." The content drives consulting leads. **Free to start today.**

**#3: Productized services ($10-50K per gig)**
After 2-3 consulting gigs give you case studies, package it: "Conference NFT Membership Package: $8K." "Shopify Token-Gating Setup: $3K." Fixed price, repeatable. Scale to $5-15K/month.

**#4: Build a tool (biggest upside, hardest)**
The gap nobody's filled: no-code NFT membership for non-crypto organizations. Guild.xyz and Galxe assume crypto-native users. Rotary clubs, alumni associations, professional conferences — they need something that hides the blockchain entirely. If you see the same pain point across 5+ consulting clients, that's your SaaS.

**#5: ENS tokens (side bet)**
Only identity token worth holding. ~$6 now, consensus $15-18 by end of 2026. Small position, not a strategy.

**The phased plan:** Consulting + Substack now (months 1-3) → productized packages (months 3-9) → SaaS tool or scale (months 9-18). Target: $15-30K/month by month 18.

The technical barrier is low — you can build a working prototype on a testnet in a weekend for $0 using thirdweb. The real edge is being the person who can explain this to non-crypto people and implement it for them. That's you.

What do you think? Want to dig deeper into any of these?

Alright, let's get back to this NFT thing. But right now, I shut my computer down, which the UniFi OS server runs on. It seemed to work fine the other day when I took it to work with me, brought it back home, hooked it back up, and UniFi came up. But now, after shutting it down and restarting it, I got:
1. It failed
2. It tried to do a backup
3. Now it's saying that ports 11002 are already in use. Those are required for the UniFi OS server to run. Please free them and try again.
Can you check what's running on port 11002? Maybe it's a UniFi process that didn't shut down properly, and maybe I just need to turn off the computer or restart the computer.

Make sure our conversations are saved, and I'll restart.

Found stale UniFi processes on port 11002: `uos-discovery` (PID 2801) and `gvproxy` (PID 3025). These didn't shut down cleanly. User restarting Mac to clear them.

Good news! Unify iOS Server is up and running. That was the last thing we were working on. 

---

## User (23:44)

Let's get back to the NFT thing. Can you put that all back up on the screen for me? I wasn't finished reading it.

---

## User (23:46)

Y-Base or Polygon on number five. I was just looking at Jordy Visser, the guy from TFTC video podcast, forget his name. He was talking about spinning up a trading platform. It was Solana and he was playing around with that.Not a trading platform. It was automated trading with an AI. I forgot.

## User (23:48)

Phoenix Trade, make a note. Need to find out more about that, but yeah, let's keep going with the NFT. 

---

## User (23:50)

No, they're both things I'd like to pursue. But yeah, I mean, if you can do both, I'll just keep reading. And, you know, I know the NFT is not related to Phoenix Trade, but they're both interesting. Note both of them and I'll keep learning and… hopefully we can make something happen with both of them.

---

## User (23:50)

Alright, so explain to me the easiest thing, how do you make money with NFTs?

---

## User (23:53)

So, how for instance could you mention Discord number two, cell access not art. I think I've mentioned I am part of Hans options with Hans, and he does a lot of different stuff, but you know, mainly focused on leaps. Real good guy, I'm fairly tight with him, and so he has I'm a paying member of his community on Discord. There's a yearly fee. He has several different tiers: leaves, he as crypto, he has what he calls "turbo trade" which is a little shorter-term leap, more than 45 days but less than a year. So, how could I do NFTs for him to sell the community moving forward instead of his yearly subscription or monthly subscription?

---

## User (23:59)

Yeah, map out the pitch for Hans.
One thought I have is: it sounds great. What I'm wondering is: how is it going to work initially if he still has mostly everybody is subscription-based currently? How does it work if he started doing the NFT passes and can he still have people signing in normally and then other people gated with the NFT?
