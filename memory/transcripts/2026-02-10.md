Good morning. Here's what's on the plate:

**Trading**
- TROW: today/tomorrow was the window to sell $105 calls if the rally stalls. Want to check the price action?

**Home Automation**
- Office lights automation is working from last night
- Still need: Home/Away automation + Keys Left Behind automation

**DET / Work**
- Foundation routing: still waiting on IT callback for login access
- Modal click-through bug still open on the Kanban board

What do you want to hit first?

---

## User (09:04)

I'm working with another cloud on the home automation stuff.

---

## Claude (09:04)



Got it — I'll leave the HA stuff alone. What do you want to work on?

---

## User (09:04)

No, I'm sorry. Wrong Claude. You are the Claude I'm working on the automation with. Markets are going to be opening soon, signing to get ready for my trading day.

---

## Claude (09:04)



Got it — I'll leave the HA stuff alone. What do you want to work on?

---

## User (09:05)

No, we're not going to work on the home automation right now.

---

## Claude (09:05)



Ha, no worries — you've got multiple Claudes going, easy to mix up.

So we're on HA duty. The office lights automation is working from last night. Next up are:

1. **Home/Away** — notify when you arrive/leave, turn off office lights when you leave
2. **Keys Left Behind** — alert if phone leaves but keys stay

The YAML is already written for both in `tools/esphome/ha_automations.yaml`. Want to set those up now, or are you testing the office lights more first?

---

## User (09:05)

 Yeah, dig into the TROW

---

## Claude (09:16)

Here's the TROW picture this morning:

## TROW at $95.81 (+1.3%)

**What happened:** Q4 earnings on Feb 4 missed — EPS $2.44 vs consensus, and the real gut punch was **$75 billion in net equity outflows** for 2025. Stock dropped from $106.65 to $91.70 in three days (14% drop). Two green days since, but barely bouncing.

**Your position status:**
- Breakeven ~$100, stock at $95.81 — still underwater
- Hard stop at $88, you have ~$7.80 cushion
- Down ~$4,300

**Key levels:**
- **Support:** $94 (current floor), $91.70 (Feb 5 low — the line), $88 (your stop)
- **Resistance:** $97-99 (gap fill), then a **wall at $100-104** where the 10/20/50/200-day MAs are all clustered

**Technicals:** Bearish. Price below ALL major moving averages. RSI at 35 (approaching oversold but not there). MACD firmly negative.

## On selling $105 calls today

**I'd hold off.** At $95.81, a $105 call is 10% OTM — the premium will be thin and not worth capping your upside on a position that needs to recover to $100+ to break even. Better to wait for a bounce toward $100-103 where you'd collect meaningful premium and have confirmation the recovery has legs.

**Watch $91.70** — if that level retests and holds, the bounce is real. If it breaks, $88 comes fast.

Want me to pull up the options chain to see what $105 calls are actually priced at?

You shouldn't be using Qwen. You should use Team Agents and spin up other clubs.

---

## User (09:20)

Yeah let's check the TROW options chain and remember we have the Alpaca MCP

---

## User (09:57)

There seems to be a problem with the Sonoff temperature and humidity sensor in my office. It will have connection and then loses connection, so it's not been working since yesterday. I wonder if the Zigbee signal is not strong enough and we need to get a hub.

---

## User (09:59)

No. When you come down the stairs, the kitchen and living room are off to the right, and my office and the front door where I'm off near the front door are off to the left.

---

## Claude (09:59)

So a kitchen router wouldn't help — it's on the wrong side of the house. The signal path is: upstairs laundry room → down the stairs → left to office. 

Cheapest fix: **a Zigbee smart plug at the bottom of the stairs** on the left side, or right in the office itself. That gives the sensor a nearby router to talk to instead of trying to reach all the way upstairs through the floor.

Or even better — if you're already planning to put a **ZBMINI-L2 in the office light switch**, that solves both problems at once: smart light control + permanent Zigbee router right next to the sensor. Two birds.

Quickest path to fix it today: grab a cheap Zigbee smart plug ($10-15) and plug it into any outlet between the stairs and the office. The mesh will rebuild automatically and the sensor should hold connection.

They don't have Trad Fry smart plugs anymore. They have a Tretakt smart plug.

## User (11:32)

Let's work on the routing rules for the DET project I have for Foundation and Routing

---

## User (11:33)

I now have access to Foundation and I'm logged in. I just took a screenshot; it's in the screenshots folder, should be the most recent one. You can see the routing rule that we have.

---

## User (11:35)

Well, now is a good time. How can I zoom in on the screen before I take a screenshot?

---

## Claude (11:35)

I can see the Foundation routing rules screen. Here's what I'm reading:

- **Rule 1 of 1** — so there's only a single routing rule right now (this is the problem)
- **Route to:** looks like it shows multiple names — John, Julie, Leanna, Jennifer?
- **When a record is:** Submitted appears checked
- **Entered by:** has some selections
- **Invoice Amount / Time Period:** appear blank

This confirms exactly what Julie described — one catch-all rule routing everything to John (and others) instead of separate rules per PM.

The screenshot is a bit small though. Can you tell me:

1. What names are in the **"Route to"** field?
2. What's selected in the **"Entered by"** field?
3. What **Record Type** is selected at the top?

Then we can plan out the 6 new rules — one per PM — using the same screen. The pattern from the training video is: duplicate this rule, then change the PM condition and the "Route to" for each one.

---

## User (11:38)

Well, we gotta remember, remoting into a Windows environment and the Command + does not work for zooming in. It's not really a browser. So I did minimize the window and took just another screenshot of the minimized window. I don't know if that's any better. When I had the capture up, it looks like you can change the format to HDR. Would that be a better resolution or higher definition for you?

---

## User (11:42)

No, that's not what I see. Are we talking about the left most column, has 7 sections. second section is "When a Record is", "Added" is checked.

---

## User (12:01)

1. Entry Katlin, julia, Leanna, Jennifer -> John
2. Added ... also has Enabled checked far right
3. Any in Dropdown radio button is selected and there are 9 dropdown boxes with nothing in them.
4. Any is selected
5. Katlin, Julia, Leanna, and Jennifer are all selected
6. nothing here
John with "all of these recipients must approve the document

---

## Claude (12:02)

You're right, my mistake — hard to tell which checkboxes are ticked at that resolution. Let me not guess. Can you just read me the 7 sections top to bottom? Just the values that are selected/filled in:

1. **Name:** 
2. **When a Record is:** (which boxes are checked?)
3. **Related to Record Type(s):**
4. **Related to Record Value(s):**
5. **Entered By User(s):**
6. **Invoice Amount:**
7. **Then Route To:**

That way I get it right and we can plan the new rules accurately.

---

## User (12:05)

in the 3rd section when I click selected and open the dropdown some choices. took a screenshot

---

## User (12:07)

Yeah, I clicked on "Add another," "Add new rule," and it created another rule, but I left it blank. I probably need to delete that rule.

---

## Claude (12:07)

There it is. The dropdown shows:

- **Geographic Area**
- **Job**
- **Project Class**
- **Project Manager**
- **Vendor**

**Project Manager** is exactly what we need. Select that, and then in section 4 ("Related to Record Value(s)") it should let you pick a specific PM name — like Devin, Johnny, etc.

Also I notice it now says **Rule 1 of 2** at the top — did you already add a new rule, or was there a second one we didn't see before?

Go ahead and select **Project Manager** from that dropdown and let's see what shows up in section 4.

---

## User (12:12)

Screenshot.

---

## User (12:12)

So the interesting thing is, the last section, then route to, the PMs haven't actually been set up as users in Foundation, so it can't be routed to them.

---

## User (12:15)

No, we can set it up for Stiltner and Johnny Wynn. I do need to talk to Julie first though. I don't think they anticipated me getting this done as quickly, so they'll need to tell me what they want to do. But I suspect we could try routing them to Stiltner and Johnny Wynn. And see if that works and go from there.

---

## Claude (12:15)

Right — makes sense not to create users without Julie's sign-off. That's her team and her system. 

Project notes updated. The three completed items (#31-#33) and the blocker are documented. When you talk to Julie, the key questions are:

1. **Start with Stiltner and Johnny** as a test — does she agree?
2. **Devin, Newly, Alfredo** — does she want user accounts created for them, or route their invoices to someone else?
3. **Should we test in the demo database first**, or go straight to production?

Anything else you want to do while you're in Foundation, or are you switching gears?

---

## User (12:35)

I talked to JuliaAnd I went ahead and created two rules, one for John Stiltner and one for Johnny Wynn. Julia showed me where I can go into accounts payable and look at the accounts payable pending invoice list. I don't see anything that's been routed to John Stiltner or Johnny Wynn, but I would imagine that you won't until a new invoice for one of those two guys is entered, and then the system will route it. 

---

## Claude (12:35)

Two rules deployed. Now we wait for invoices to flow through and confirm. What's next?

---

## User (12:37)

I want to talk about part of this that we could automate at the very beginning of this whole process where an email comes in to AP, and Leanna separates out the individual invoices from one big PDF. Then, she puts those invoices in the folder for either Jennifer to process or Caitlin to enter. The folders are Dropbox team folders. What I want to know is could we automate this process with some Python and an AI, a cloud agent that could have access to the AP email, pull the PDF, split it up into the individual job PDFs, and then use the Dropbox API to put the invoice in the appropriate Dropbox folder.

---

## User (12:45)

1. MS 365. You should log this to memory.
2. yes. This is where we would have to think in robust terms: "What if a vendor does include multiple PDFs for each job instead of a single PDF?"There may be other variances in the way the invoices are sent.Some of these vendors may have B2B back-end systems that we could potentially tap into. I just put a document in a new subfolder gray bar in the docs folder for you to take a look at. They offer EDI XML, but anyway, take a look at the doc.

## User (12:50)

Can you hit that URL and see all the things that are available under that? There's a whole bunch. Looks like Capital Electric also has maybe something available. 

---

## Claude (12:50)

Capital Electric has a full suite. Here's what they offer:

## Capital Electric Supply Digital Solutions

- **EDI/Punchout** — electronic data interchange, same as Graybar
- **eProcurement** — [direct procurement integration](https://www.capitalelectricsupply.com/services/digital-solutions/eprocurement)
- **eQuotes** — electronic quoting
- **eLink** — system connectivity
- **Digital Job Center** — job-level management
- **Release Off Blanket Order** — automated ordering against blanket POs
- **Workflow and User Management** — approval workflows
- **Mobile App**
- **My Product Lists**
- **Digital Support Desk**

They support **EDI, XML, and email** formats — very similar to Graybar's eChannel offering.

This is a pattern. Your two biggest electrical distributors (Graybar and Capital Electric) both offer B2B electronic invoicing. If DET enables EDI/XML with just these two vendors, you'd probably eliminate a huge chunk of the PDF splitting work Leanna does, since they're likely your highest-volume suppliers.

The smart play is **two-pronged**:
1. **EDI integration** with Graybar + Capital Electric (and any other large vendors that offer it) — eliminates manual work entirely for those vendors
2. **AI PDF pipeline** for the long tail of smaller vendors who only email PDFs

Want me to add a task to survey which other DET vendors offer EDI/XML? Julie or Leanna would know the top 10 vendors by invoice volume — that's the list to check.

## User (12:52)

All right, can you write up a quick email that I'd like to send to Julia with what we found here with just Graybar and Capital, on how we could connect to them and pull these invoices in, at least pull them in and get them into Dropbox easier, and maybe even into Foundation.She's not technical, so just please explain it for a non-technical person. I'd want to get her feedback first before we propose something like this to John.John's always been even though he's a big tech geek and loves building computers, he hates IT. 

---

## User (13:58)

I sent it. 

---

## User (14:29)

Was it you or the other Claude that we talked about network chunk and how he got Claude Prompt on my iPhone in particular? 

---

## User (14:29)

He used tmux. Does that ring any bells?

---

## User (14:29)

He used tmux. Does that ring any bells?

---

## Claude (14:29)

Nothing about "network chunk" or Claude on iPhone in my sessions. That was definitely the other Claude instance. You'll want to check with them on that.

Can you take a look at that and see why the Unifi server keeps blowing up? This is like the third or fourth time that I've had to restore it from backup.

---

## User (15:05)

Yeah, maybe we'll try to do the ASUS desktop tonight. Right now, I got to go to DET. See ya. 

---

## Claude (15:05)

Here's the pattern. The UniFi OS Server keeps dying because of **Podman VM crashes tied to Mac sleep/wake cycles and network changes**.

## The Root Cause

UniFi OS Server v5.0.6 runs inside a **Podman virtual machine** on your Mac. The problem:

1. **Mac goes to sleep** (lid close, screen saver, or macOS power management)
2. The Podman VM loses its network socket connection
3. When the Mac wakes up, the UniFi app tries to reconnect but the **Podman socket is dead** — `connection refused` on `127.0.0.1:60113`
4. The UniFi container inside the VM is gone. The app can't recover.

The logs show this cycle clearly:
- **Dec 20-21:** Repeated `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` — Mac sleeping overnight
- **Jan 3-4:** `ERR_TIMED_OUT` every hour for 19+ hours straight, then `ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED` — Podman VM was zombie, Mac network changed
- **Feb 10 @ 8:56 AM:** Websocket closed → restarted at 8:58 → Podman socket refused → had to reinitialize the machine
- **Feb 10 @ 2:31 PM:** Same thing — websocket closed, restarted at 3:00 PM, Podman completely dead again

## Why This Keeps Happening

The UniFi OS Server Mac app is running a **Linux VM via Podman** (similar to Docker Desktop). These lightweight VMs are notoriously bad at surviving macOS sleep/wake. The VM's network forwarding (gvproxy) dies, and there's no automatic recovery.

## Fixes

**Short-term:** Prevent your Mac from sleeping while UniFi is running:
```
caffeinate -d &
```
This keeps the display/system awake. Kill the process when you don't need it.

**Medium-term:** In System Settings → Energy, disable "Put hard disks to sleep when possible" and set sleep timers to Never when you're using the Mac as a server.

**Long-term (the real fix):** This is exactly why we talked about moving the UniFi controller to dedicated hardware. A Mac laptop is a terrible host for a 24/7 network controller because it sleeps. The old desktop running Ubuntu Server, or the GMKtec NucBox down the road, would eliminate this entirely — Linux servers don't sleep.

The $0 path is still the old ASUS desktop with Ubuntu Server. That would solve this permanently.

I'm going to shut down the terminal, so make sure all your memories are saved and logged. I don't want you to miss anything when we pick things back up.
