## Events & Notes

### Lost Session (earlier today)

### Post-Restart Session (evening)

**Projects Created:**

**Network Security Project - Major Progress:**
- [x] Flashed DietPi to Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
- [x] Installed AdGuard Home (replaced Pi-hole plan - more modern)
- [x] Installed Unbound for recursive DNS (no third-party DNS)
- [x] Configured 5 blocklists (~590K rules): AdGuard, OISD, URLhaus, Phishing Army, DandelionSprout

- [x] Configured UniFi DHCP to use AdGuard as DNS
