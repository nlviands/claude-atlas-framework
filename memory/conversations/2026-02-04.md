# Conversation Log: February 4, 2026

## Session Summary
First major working session setting up the Claude Atlas Framework multi-agent system.

## Key Topics Discussed

### Multi-Agent LLM System
- Built 4-agent system: Codex (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Grok (xAI), Qwen (local MLX)
- Established pipeline architecture with lateral handoffs
- Claude remains orchestrator, reviews all agent outputs
- Agents can hand off to each other in defined pipelines

### Data Integration
- Connected Alpaca MCP for real-time market data
- Added news search via WebSearch
- Built technical indicators tool (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, MAs)
- Options chain data for sentiment analysis

### Investment Research Pipeline
- Tested with NVDA analysis
- Real data showed stock near 13-week low ($174.19)
- News about stalled OpenAI investment affecting price
- Options IV elevated ahead of Feb 25 earnings

### Report Types Discussion
- Norm prefers natural language requests over rigid report types
- I interpret intent and pull relevant data
- Iterative refinement: give report, Norm asks for additions
- "Too much friction" to remember specific report names

### Memory & Conversation Logging
- Discussed need for persistent memory across sessions
- PERSONAL.md imported from chief_of_staff project
- RAG system already exists (OpenAI embeddings + SQLite)
- Setting up conversation logging for future reference

## Key Decisions Made
1. Natural language interface for reports (no menu of report types)
2. Claude gathers data based on interpreted intent
3. Conversation logging for persistent context
4. Personal context shared across Claude instances

## Norm's Preferences Noted
- Prefers concise, direct communication
- Wants accountability ("don't let me off the hook")
- Natural language over structured commands
- Iterative refinement over upfront specification

## Technical Notes
- Qwen runs on localhost:8080 via MLX (must use 127.0.0.1, not localhost due to gvproxy conflict)
- Gemini model updated to gemini-2.0-flash (1.5-pro deprecated)
- Grok model updated to grok-3 (grok-beta deprecated)
- UV used for Python package management

### Network Security & Pi-hole Project (Evening Session)
- Discussed UniFi Insights showing unwanted international traffic
- Want to block: China, India, some African countries
- UniFi hardware: UXG Max gateway, U6 LR switch, U7 Pro Wall AP, U6 LR AP
- UXG Max has Threat Management with built-in geo-blocking (Settings → Security → Threat Management)
- Pi-hole needs fresh install - old setup from Windows era, credentials unknown
- Was using Unbound for recursive DNS (not Cloudflare/DoT)
- Pi-hole plugged directly into gateway (not switch) - better for reliability
- Discussed Zone-Based Firewall upgrade in UniFi - recommended to upgrade
- Created projects.md for tracking projects with grouped tasks
- 10 tasks created for full network security setup

## Project Tracking System Established
- Created projects.md at repo root for multi-project tracking
- Each project has: status, goal, hardware/components, task IDs, notes
- Updated MEMORY.md to reference projects.md
- Learned behavior added: check projects.md at session start
