## 1. Barclays: "The AI Fear Trade Seems Overdone"

- US macro solid — 2.5% GDP growth expected for 2026, strong payrolls, moderate CPI
- **AI selloff is overdone.** Example: CHRW cratered on fear that RIME (a karaoke machine company) built AI trucking software. But CHRW's bonds didn't move — pure sentiment, not fundamentals.
- **Japan stabilizing.** Markets settled after Takaichi election. BoJ expected to hike April, October, then April 2027 to 1.5% terminal. Barclays does NOT expect Japan to upset the current balance.
- Bullish risk assets, long US 3-year point, **US steepeners** (confirms IEF > TLT thesis)
- **Supreme Court IEEPA decision Friday** could be a catalyst

## 2. BofA: Global Fund Manager Survey — "Capex Too Hot"

Most important report of the 4. Key numbers:

- **Most bullish since June 2021.** Bull & Bear indicator at 9.5 = **contrarian SELL signal** active since Dec 17
- Cash rose to 3.4% from record-low 3.2% — first rise in 7 months (smart money adding buffer)
- **57% expect HIGHER long-term rates, 46% expect LOWER short-term rates** — steepening trade confirmed
- #1 tail risk: **AI bubble (25%)**, then inflation (20%), disorderly bond yields (17%)
- #1 credit event source: **Private equity/credit (43%)**, AI hyperscaler capex (30%), Japanese govt debt (14%)
- Most crowded trade: **Long gold (50%)**, Long Mag 7 (20%), Short USD (12%)
- Gold target: ~$6,200/oz (23% upside from current)

### FMS Rotation Signal:
- INTO: energy, materials, staples, Eurozone, EM
- OUT OF: US tech, USD
- Small caps expected to outperform large caps (first time in 10 months)
- Value over growth (strongest since Apr '25)
- Record 23% overweight Euro equities
- EM overweight highest since Feb '21

**This IS the Visser trade.** Long scarcity (energy, materials, ex-US), short abundance (US tech, SaaS).

## 3. BofA: Trading Catalysts — "Navigating the AI Disruption Selloff"

Actionable for the week:

- **Key data:** FOMC minutes Wednesday, GDP Friday, PCE Friday
- **AI selloff buying opportunities:** BKNG, DASH, CDNS
  - CDNS (Cadence Design Systems): AI is an enabler not disruptor, ~80% recurring revenue, no near-term AI substitute for EDA tools
  - BKNG: Deep supplier relationships, loyalty ecosystems, proprietary data = moat against AI disruption
- **Historic tech dispersion** — top decile since 1995, only surpassed by dotcom. Software vs Semis divergence = bubble-like reassessment
- **Options screens for earnings week:**
  - Cheap implied vol + high EPS estimates (long call candidates): **SO, NEM, EQT, OXY, CEG**
  - Expensive implied vol + low estimates (short put candidates): RNG, EBAY, ETSY
- Materials & Energy getting bid on AI capex exposure (power, infrastructure)

## 4. BofA: US Banks — "AI in Financials"

Panel: Ed Sim (Boldstart), Peter Yared (InCountry), Julian Levy (Elevata Ventures)

- **Agent-native startups** (built from scratch for AI) crushing legacy firms trying to bolt AI onto old systems
- AI adoption in banking **faster than cloud adoption**
- First deployments: back-office — KYC, AML, document handling
- **"Anthropic's Claude" specifically named** for automating large volumes of work
- SaaS under pressure — internal teams using AI to recreate workflows they used to outsource
- Infrastructure vendors more durable than workflow SaaS
- **AI bubble is "a feature not a bug"** — infrastructure retains value even through correction
- Mid-tier banks adopting early in KYC could **leapfrog** larger institutions

## Convergence Map — All Sources Point Same Direction

| Source | Signal |
|--------|--------|
| **Visser (22V)** | Long scarcity, short abundance. Turbulence model flashing. |
| **Hans (Discord)** | Cautious/defensive. Dumped LITE. IEF over TLT. VIX futures concerned. |
| **Barclays** | AI fear overdone. Steepeners. Japan stabilizing. |
| **BofA FMS** | Rotation into energy/materials/EM, out of US tech. Contrarian sell signal active. |
| **BofA Trading** | BKNG/CDNS as AI-selloff buys. Historic tech dispersion. |
| **Zeihan** | Japan debt = global long-end bond pressure. Reinforces IEF > TLT. |

## Key Takeaways for Norm's Portfolio

1. **IEF steepening trade confirmed** from every angle — short end benefits from Fed cuts, long end faces structural headwinds
2. **Energy names (OXY, EQT, CEG)** showing up in BofA options screens AND Visser's scarcity bucket
3. **TROW fits value-over-growth rotation** but account cash constraints may force early exit
4. **BofA FMS sell signal at 9.5** — expect a pullback before rotation fully plays out
5. **BKNG, CDNS** as potential AI-fear buying opportunities (BKNG ~$4,000/share, options needed)
6. **Gold** is the most crowded trade (50%) with $6,200 target — already long via sentiment
7. **Week's catalysts:** FOMC minutes Wed, GDP Fri, PCE Fri, IEEPA Supreme Court Fri
