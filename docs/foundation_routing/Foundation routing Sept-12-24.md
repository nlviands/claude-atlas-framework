# TEXT
    And yeah, let's get into it. So to start out with, I just want to explain kind of the two primary functions of document imaging. Uh so the first one is going to
0:07
be routing AP invoices for approval. And that's something that will allow you to like as you're entering invoices, uh
0:14
send those invoices to someone else uh to be able to review them and either approve them or maybe make some changes
0:19
to fix things on that invoice uh before getting that that invoice posted.
0:25
Um so that's going to be the first part. The second part is going to be tracking documents, um, uploading images into
0:30
your actual database and being able to refer refer back to those images when you need to um, download them, export
0:37
them from other workstations and just have them available from anywhere that you can access Foundation.
0:43
Now, I'm thinking we'll start out with uh, by talking about the the image uploads.
0:48
And the first thing to mention with those image uploads is that uh, there are certain file types that we're able
0:54
to upload and others that won't work. Um, so the files that we can upload are going to be PDFs, uh, JPGs, uh, BMPPS,
1:01
and PNGs. So those are all just different types of image files. Um, and that's what we'd be looking for as far
1:07
as, you know, what we're able to to put into the database. Um, now, as far as what types of images
1:12
you would upload, that can vary pretty widely just depending on how you want to use the system. Um, we can attach images
1:18
to almost anything in Foundation. Um there will be some limitations but um
1:24
some common ones would be job records you know attaching things like your job plans, your blueprints, anything like
1:29
that. Um you can upload employment documentation to your employee records, you know, resumes, uh W4s, um things of
1:37
that nature. Vendors is another really common one for W9s and maybe master
1:42
subcontract agreements. And then invoices by far would be the most commonly used one just to be able to
1:48
attach an actual picture of the invoice that you're entering. Um, and that's especially useful if we're going to send
1:54
it to someone else for approval because then they'll be able to view that physical invoice while they're looking at the one that you entered and, you
2:00
know, make any changes that might be necessary or just verify that it's correct. Um, so with that being said, I want to
2:07
start showing you how we can actually upload those documents. And I'm going to start by just looking at some job records. So, we're going to go to job
2:13
cost maintenance here. Get into our jobs.
2:27
Bear with me here. My Foundation and Document Imaging are installed locally on my computer, so it may run a little
2:33
bit slower than some of your systems do.
2:41
All right. So, if we wanted to attach an image to a job record, or really any record for that matter, we have to start
2:47
by going into modify mode and pulling up the record that we want to attach something to. Um, so maybe I'll pull up
2:52
my non-budgeted job. And while we're looking at this job
2:58
record, if we look at our foundation toolbar, the blue toolbar up here, uh, this button right kind of towards the
3:04
right hand side is going to be our import images button. And this is always what we're going to use if we want to attach an image to a record in
3:10
Foundation. One way to describe this would be that it's the only only button that has a little bit of color in this
3:16
toolbar. You know, there's a little yellow and white there, but you know, that's the one that we're going to be looking for. Now, anywhere in Foundation
3:22
that you see this button, you would be looking at a record that you're able to attach images to. Uh, so keep an eye out
3:28
for that. And I will show you like a full list of all the records you can attach things to. Um, but it's a pretty
3:33
big list, so just keep an eye out for that to have an idea of where you can upload images.
3:38
Now, if I wanted to attach something to this non-budgeted job, I'm going to click that import images button, and it
3:44
is going to open up a separate window, uh, document imaging window here. I'll
3:49
pull that over in just a second when it gets pulled up here.
4:06
Bear with me here.
4:12
There it goes. All right. So, this is our our import images window. This is uh what it's
4:18
going to look like anytime we try to attach an image to a record. Um, and one thing I'll point out is that this is an
4:24
independent window. Uh, so you can, you know, put this on your second monitor or move it around, do whatever you need to
4:30
with it there. Um, and and when we're attaching images, there's going to be two ways that we can
4:36
attach an image. And we're going to start out just with the most straightforward way, which is a single file upload.
4:43
Now, if I wanted to do that, I could come up to the very top here, this little ribbon across the top, and there's some different options. Um, for
4:50
a single file upload, though, we would look at this document section, and we would choose to add a document.
4:55
When we do that, it's going to open up a file browser window, something you're probably familiar with or used to to some extent, and we can navigate through
5:02
the computer and and find the image that we might want to attach. I'm going to switch folders here.
5:15
Oops.
5:21
get my job files and we'll just attach a job plans image here.
5:28
Now, when we do that, it's going to show up in this yellow document section. Uh, this section is going to show any images
5:33
that have already that are currently attached to the record that you're looking at. Um, so seeing it there, that's how we know it's been attached
5:39
and and that one's all done. Um, now this at this point, this would be done really. you know, if we were to
5:45
close out of this window, um, that image is attached at this point and we can kind of verify that because we see this
5:51
little file cabinet icon at the top of your screen. So, anywhere we see this file cabinet icon, we know that we're
5:57
looking at something that has images attached to it. And if we wanted to view those images to see what's attached, we
6:03
can just click that little button. It's going to open up the same import images window. Um, only this time there will be
6:08
an image in that document section already since we've already attached it here.
6:14
Bear with me here. I'll keep it open this time.
6:36
So there we go. We got our documents in here. Um, now there are some additional things that we can do with this window.
6:43
Uh, when we're attaching documents, uh, we can create and then connect these labels to your images. And so I've
6:50
already gone through and created some example labels here, but these are really just different types of images that you might be uploading to your
6:55
database. And this can be useful later on because we we have a search feature for all these documents that I'll be showing
7:01
you. And when we're using that search feature, uh we can search by a bunch of different things, you know, dates, jobs.
7:08
Um but these labels are one of the criteria that we get. Now, if we wanted to attach a label, um
7:13
with my current layout, it's pretty easy to do. I can just come over to this available label section. And with this
7:20
one, it's a job plan. So, I would grab my job plans label, and I can just drag it over and drop it on top of that
7:25
document. And you see you get this little yellow tag icon that tells us just visually that this has a label on
7:31
it. And then if we select that that image, we can see in the bottom right corner here uh that the the labels for
7:37
this image are job plans. Um and again that's just a little bit of anformational piece so that when we're
7:43
searching for documents, we can pull together groups of documents a little bit easier.
7:49
Uh now some of the other things that we're looking at here, we get this preview window. Uh this of course is just a preview of the image that we've
7:56
selected. If we had multiple documents here, you know, we can click through them and and look at all the different images. There's also a batch window. Uh
8:03
this is for the the second option when it comes to attaching images to a record. I'm going to be I'm going to be
8:09
explaining that one in a little bit here. So, we're going to skip it for right now. Um and one big thing that some of you may have noticed is that
8:15
this might not look like your your document imaging window does when you first open it up. And that's going to be
8:21
because this is this whole window is very customizable as far as the layout that we're looking at. Um, and there's,
8:27
you know, each of these sections uh that are colored, they're actually like sort of sub windows that we can grab and we
8:32
can move them around to resize things, reorganize things. And it's got some
8:38
pretty nice features that have it auto snap. See here?
8:44
Whoops. That's getting a little crazy.
8:53
Now, let me show you how it's going to look when you first come into document imaging. Kind of the default view.
9:02
So, up here across the top, we also have some different tabs, and one of those is going to be your appearance tab. Now, we
9:08
do have some like default custom layouts that you can pick from. Uh the one that you would have when you first open this
9:14
window up is going to be number three here. So, it'll look something like this. Um, now, personally, I like to
9:20
customize this a lot so that it works just it's a little easier to use and works better, more efficiently when
9:25
you're attaching images. Um, this batch window, again, we're going to be talking about it later on, but when we're using
9:31
batch windows, we don't need it to be so big. So, I like to shrink that down a little bit. Um, this pages window is one
9:37
that I had removed on my previous view. Um, but pages may or may not be necessary for you. It just kind of
9:42
depends on the type of documents that you upload. Um, you know, with this document that we have. It's a one-page
9:48
document, so this wouldn't really be very necessary. Um, but if we did want to add additional pages to this
9:53
document, um, we can we can do that. Um, and just, you know, connect them
10:00
together so that when you're exporting your one image, it's going to it's going to link all your different pages together. Just makes it a little bit
10:06
easier. U, another option that you have with these windows is you can rightclick your
10:11
documents and you can rename them. Um, so especially if you're, you know, getting, you know, if we're thinking about invoices or maybe you have a
10:18
scanner that you're using to, um, put these these different images onto your computer or your server, a lot of times
10:24
that might give them like default names where it's a bunch of mumbo jumbo that doesn't really uh, indicate anything.
10:29
Uh, so if you wanted to, as you're looking at these documents, you can rightclick and rename them just so it makes a little bit more sense there as
10:35
well. Now, when we're in this appearance section, we've got some color schemes that we can choose from. I'm just going
10:41
to stick with silver for today. We've got those default layouts I mentioned. And then we can also save layouts when
10:47
we are customizing the layout. So, you know, if we were to get rid of our pages window because we're not going to use
10:53
multi-page documents, we could come up here and save that so that when we close this and open it back up again, we're
10:58
not having to go through the formatting options again. So, that's definitely something to keep in mind. Um, this next
11:05
section is controlling what's going to be shown in this window. So you can see here's all those color-coded uh sub
11:10
windows that we've been looking at. We could bring pages back here if we wanted to. And then this is also where we can
11:16
add in the section that I had on the right for labels.
11:22
You can see that gives us two windows. We've got available labels and labels uh that are already attached to the
11:27
document we're looking at. Um and so if that is something you wanted to utilize, just remember that we will have to turn it on because it's not going to be there
11:33
by default. Um, and then once it's turned on, we can move it around here.
11:39
Mine's going to be a little goofy since I'm sharing my screen like I am, but generally when you move this around, you'll see some little popups um that
11:46
will have it auto snap and kind of insert it between different uh items that you might look at there. There they are. So, you can see if I wanted this to
11:53
the right of my pages window, I could hover on this and drop it and it'll it'll insert it between those. Now
12:00
again, mine is behaving a little bizarre with Goto Webinar running at the same time, but um yeah, it should be pretty
12:07
straightforward when you get here and start playing with it. Um now, I'm actually going to close out of this window for a moment.
12:14
And see here,
12:21
I'm going to pull it back up just so we can get my custom format back. It'll make a little bit more sense while we're
12:26
looking at it here.
12:52
All right, so back to our good layout. Uh, a couple other small things I want to point out with this window is that we
12:58
can control the the zoom here. Um, which I mean that's pretty self-explanatory. You can zoom in or zoom out, but um
13:05
there's also these two buttons here where you can kind of have it zoom to fit the space that you have available. Uh, which is pretty nice because it just
13:12
makes it easy to see the whole document all at once. Um, and then also at the top we've got some um some different
13:19
options like if we wanted to add pages to this document. This is where we're going to add additional pages to our job
13:24
plans. In fact, I'll show you that here real quick.
13:30
I'm just going to I'm going to duplicate my page because I don't have a whole lot of examples here. But
13:41
all right, get that pulled back up. Sorry about that.
14:16
All righty. Um, now I've been talking about the first option that we have for attaching images, just doing a single file upload
14:23
and choosing one document at a time that we want to attach. Um, but another feature that we have is going to be
14:28
called batch uploads. That's what this uh purple window is going to be for as well. Uh, and a batch upload is a a
14:35
little tough to explain, but I'll I'll show you some examples as well. Um, essentially what it allows us to do is
14:40
we can create folders on, you know, either your workstation or maybe on your your server, uh, so that everyone can
14:47
access them and we can link those folders to Foundation, uh, which makes it so that any images that get added to
14:53
that folder will just appear automatically in this batch window when we open it up. And that can be nice
14:59
because as you're, you know, gathering all this documentation, especially with invoices, uh, you can just direct all
15:04
those files to the same location on your computer. And then when you go in to actually make the entries or attach
15:10
these images to any records, uh, you can come up to the top left corner here and choose to open a batch.
15:17
And I actually have multiple batches. So I get some options here where I can choose which one. You can see I've got a job batch and I've got a vendor batch.
15:24
Go with our job batch here. And then when we open that up, all of the images that are in my my job files
15:31
folder, which we saw a second ago here, are going to show up in this batch window.
15:37
And then from here, instead of having to to click that add documents button and navigate through all your different file
15:42
folders and everything, um, we can either just doubleclick these documents
15:47
or drag and drop the documents. We can rightclick and add the document to whatever we're looking at. Um, and
15:54
that's just another option that we have. Now you can see was when I'm attaching this to uh to our record, it actually
16:00
disappears from your batch window. Um and the batches are a little bit intuitive in the sense that they'll keep
16:05
track of what has been attached to something versus what has not been attached to something. And it's only
16:10
going to show you items in that folder that have not already been attached to a record previously in the system. Um, and
16:16
because of that, these batches can almost act like a to-do list because you if you ever open one of these up and uh
16:22
you see that something is missing from this window, uh, that's how we know that we still need to get it attached somewhere. It's it's not been um, you
16:28
know, connected to that record in Foundation. Yeah. Um, now another thing I'll point
16:36
out is that even though I've now attached that that image, get this pulled up here.
16:45
If we look at the actual job files folder that I have on my computer, you
16:50
can see all four of those images still exist in the system. So, it's not deleting them when we attach them or anything like that. Uh, it's just
16:57
marking them as having been uploaded so that it knows we don't need to upload it again and we're not accidentally doubling anything up.
17:03
Um, now because of this, these folders can get to be pretty big over time. Um, and since we're attaching them in
17:09
Foundation and uploading them to your actual database, they will be saved on on your databases servers. Um, so I
17:15
would say you are okay to get rid of these documents. Um, and you know, if you don't like the idea of getting rid
17:21
of them from your your local workstation altogether, um, one recommendation might just be to archive these images
17:27
occasionally. Um, and that would just be, you know, opening this file up when you don't see anything in this batch
17:33
window so that you can verify that everything in the folder has already been attached to a record in the system.
17:38
And as long as you're seeing nothing in this batch window, um, then you would know it's all been attached and you could, uh, either move it to a different
17:45
folder, compress it, you know, do whatever you need to from there. As far as how often you would do that, that
17:50
would just be up to you. So u but again we do save them on the databases server and you'll always be able to come in
17:57
here and export them or uh email them whatever you need to. So uh we just
18:02
there's not really a need for that. Now I'm going to close out of this
18:08
window and we're going to move on to some other records here and look at some invoice entries. Kind of how we can use
18:14
those batch windows for your invoice uploads.
18:19
Close out here. Actually, I'm sorry. Before I close out of this window, one very important thing to point out is
18:26
that when we attach an image to a record, you know, we we close out of your document imaging window and we can
18:31
see this little file cabinet icon. Just because that file cabinet icon is there, doesn't mean that it's going to save
18:37
that image yet. Um, so if we like I just tried to close this window, if I had said yes, I want to close without saving
18:43
any changes. When I open this job back up, there's not going to be any any image attached to it. Um, so attaching
18:49
an image to a record, it does qualify as a change just like if we changed any of your dollar amounts or any of these
18:55
other fields. And so we do have to make sure we click the okay button to get that saved um before we we move on to
19:01
anything else. I'm going to close out of this window here
19:10
and we'll get over to our AP module and start talking about how this can work with your invoice uploads, also how to
19:16
create those batches. So, I'm going to go into enter invoices under AP.
19:23
And the first thing you would want to do if you are trying to set up a batch is we want to make sure you you've got the folder created. Um, and we also need to
19:30
have at least some images in there. Um, so we would want to go, you know, if you're going to do it on your own workstation just for personal use, you
19:37
might go to your desktop and create a folder called AP invoices. Uh, if you want to have one folder that multiple
19:43
different AP people can access, you may want to set up a folder on a shared server. um so that when they're trying
19:49
to access that server through Foundation, they're able to. Um but when we're ready to do that, we
19:55
can I'm just going to show you an example as I'm entering an invoice here. So, I'm going to choose a vendor first.
20:02
Get a job in here. Actually, I'll do an an overhead
20:07
invoice. So, let's just get rid of that job.
20:16
We'll say it's worth $1,000.
20:22
All right.
20:31
All right. Now, with this invoice entry, before we save it, uh, we want to hit that import images button again. I'm
20:37
going to click that here. We'll get our popup window in a moment. Again, this should be a bit quicker on
20:43
your computers. It's just where I've got it installed is not ideal.
21:09
All right. So, this is our same document imaging window. It's going to look the same no matter what record you're attaching an image to. Um, so in this
21:16
case, we're attaching to our invoices, but we got the same layout. Now, up in the top left here where we've got our
21:21
batch section, um, we can open batches, but I don't have one set up for my AP invoices yet. So, I'm actually going to
21:27
be creating a batch to start. Now, when we do that, we get this little
21:33
uh popup window, another file browsing window, and we can go through the system and navigate to whatever location you
21:40
decided to create that folder at. In my case, it's on my one drive here. So, I'm just going to select that folder, and
21:45
then click okay. Now, that's created my batch, and these
21:51
are the four invoices that I had in that batch folder ready to go. Um, and before I attach something, just some other
21:57
stuff that you can do with these batches. Um, there is a property section. Uh, this is pretty important if you're going to be setting up multiple
22:03
batches like I have where I've got one for jobs, one for vendors, one for invoices. Um, because by default, you
22:09
can see the name is just a number. It it's not very explanatory. Um, so we would want to hit properties
22:15
and we can enter a little description in our popup window. Say AP invoices.
22:22
Um, and then if there were any notes that you wanted to make, you could do that as well. But, you know, in this case, it's all going to be invoices. So,
22:29
you might not need to have any special notes there. An example of how you could use those notes, though, actually would
22:34
be on my like on my job batch folder. I've got some notes that say that it's going to be job files, blueprints,
22:40
plans, um, things like that. So, just give you an idea of what's in that batch.
22:47
Um, some other options that you have up here is to refresh the batch. So, if you're not seeing something, you're like, I know I just put that image in
22:53
this folder. Always a good idea just to refresh it. make sure we're we've got the most up-to-date information in this
22:58
screen. Um, and then maybe we open the wrong batch and so we need to switch. We can also close the batch and that'll
23:05
just take it away. That way we can go back to open batch and choose a different one instead. And this is where
23:11
you can see I've got them named with some descriptions here. In this case, I want my AP invoices. So I'll click okay.
23:19
All right. And then I'm just going to go ahead. I'll grab this overhead invoice and drag that over here to get it attached.
23:26
And I'm also going to attach a label since I've got a label for my office and
23:31
overhead invoices here. And that would be it. I'm going to keep
23:36
this window open for this example. Actually, I'm going to try to split screen this a little bit.
23:47
See how much this cooperates.
23:58
All right. Um, and actually, I don't know that I mentioned this, but um, what I'm about to show you, I want to point out that there's uh, it tells you at the
24:05
top of your document imaging window which transaction you're attaching something to. So, that's how you can
24:10
always verify you're on the right record. Um, but now, if I go back to Foundation, you can see I've got my
24:16
little file cabinet icon, so I know it's recognizing the image that I attached. I'm going to go ahead and click okay
24:21
again to get this validated and get it saved. Oh, that was not a good selection here.
24:30
We'll just come down to our office supplies.
24:37
All right. So, now I'm saving that record and that that image is attached now. So, if we're ever trying to go back
24:43
and see that invoice, um we'd be able to pull it up from our document search, which I'll show you in a little bit here. But that's really all there is to
24:50
it. Now, if I go back to my document imaging window, you can see it doesn't say we're
24:55
adding to that specific transaction number anymore. Um, and you can actually keep this window open all the time,
25:01
especially when you're doing invoice entries, and it'll just keep pace with you as you're entering invoices. Uh, so
25:06
this is a little tough to show on one screen. Let me see if I can maybe shrink this down a little bit here.
25:14
So, I'm just going to start entering another invoice here. We'll do our office supplies.
25:21
Um, no job again. But right away, you can see now I'm adding to transaction 110 for just stay in office supplies.
25:29
Um, so you can just like ideally what a lot of people like to do is you'll keep this window, this document imaging
25:35
window open on your second monitor and then just have foundation up like you normally would on your main monitor. And
25:41
then even before you you start making your entry, you know, you can click on the batch invoices because again, the
25:47
only invoices that show up here would be ones that haven't been attached yet. Um, so it's like a little to-do list and I
25:53
would say, okay, I need to get this one entered. I can use my little preview window to look more closely at that
25:58
invoice and see what vendor I need. And then I can start making that entry here. So again, you know, picking your vendor
26:04
and then as soon as I've selected the vendor and I get my transaction number, I may also want to enter the rest of my details. Um, but now I am adding to that
26:12
specific transaction. So then I could come over and attach it. You know, I go through the rest of my entry here.
26:24
Move it over so you can see the whole thing a little bit.
26:33
Oops. And then we click okay to save it. And
26:38
we're on to the next one. And again, you can see now we're down to two invoices because we've entered two out of those original four that were here.
26:46
Um, so yeah, just some cool ways that batches can help make things a little bit more efficient, help keep track of
26:51
what you still need to do versus what's been done already. Um, another thing with this, because, you know, there's
26:57
always times where maybe you enter an invoice and you forget to attach an image to it. Well, if you're using this
27:02
like a to-do list to some extent, you know, you'd see it here and think that you still need to enter it. You might not remember that you had already. Um,
27:08
but in theory, when you're going in to make that entry, you pick your vendor and you pick your invoice number. And if
27:14
that was already entered, it would give you an error message from the duplicated invoice number. And that would tell you right away that it was entered already.
27:20
you just need to go back and modify that invoice so that you can attach a record to it,
27:25
which I'll show you that uh that we can do that as well real quick here.
27:31
Back to ad mode. We'll get a quick invoice in.
27:41
And this time I am going to forget to attach my image.
27:46
Um, but whether it's posted or unposted, we can go into modify mode. In this case, it's unposted. So, I am going to
27:51
modify my unposted invoices. I'll use my little magnifying glass to grab the right transaction number.
28:00
And then, as long as I pull it back up in modify mode, uh, I can reattach an image to it. And then when I save, it
28:07
will it'll still be there for you even though you forgot to do it when you initially entered it.
28:14
All right. Now, that's the bulk of of what I'd like to talk about when it comes to attaching
28:20
images to different records in Foundation. Um, the next thing I want to get start getting into though is uh the the
28:27
invoice routing that we can set up. Um, that's definitely a big part of of document imaging. It enables some pretty
28:34
cool workflows that you can set up and approval processes. Um, so yeah, we're going to get into that now. Now, with
28:40
with invoice routing, um, it can only be done for AP invoices. So that's one thing to keep in mind. At the moment, we
28:46
don't offer an approval workflow for anything else in the system. And with that, we can we can route invoices
28:53
approve for approval one of two ways. So we can either manually route the invoice, which is just when we're making
28:59
the entry, we choose to route it. I'll show you that here in a moment. And then we choose who we want to send it to for
29:05
approval. Um, so that would be one option. Another option though is to set up rules that automate the routing. And
29:12
there's a lot of flexibility with that. So, we can do it um with a lot of different options to automate it, you
29:17
know, based on project manager, based on vendor, based on the person that entered it. So, we'll definitely take a look at
29:23
some of those options as well. Now, to start out with, I'm just going to go in. I want to show you how we can
29:29
just manually route an invoice. And I'm going to go into enter invoices once more.
29:57
All right. Now, I'm going to come in and I'll enter another invoice here.
30:05
I'm going to go with Home Depot. and we'll use our TNM job.
30:15
Now, when we're entering an invoice that we want to send off to get approved, we still are going to have to enter any
30:21
normal fields that would be required on your invoice entries. Um, now I'm going to fill in some that are not required
30:27
just for my example here. Um, but because of that, things like your job costing information, we do have to fill
30:33
it out to be able to save it and route it to someone. And I know it's pretty common that uh some people may uh may
30:41
want the approvers like the person that we're sending the invoice to to be the the one that actually decides which cost
30:47
code it's going to be or you know figures out all that job costing detail. Uh so let me pick an expense account
30:53
here and I'll give you some options to kind of accommodate that still. Um so the job number go ahead and plug
31:00
that in here. Oops. Then these this one is usually the the
31:06
big one that people are less certain about. Um so if you the person entering your AP invoice knows the cost code then
31:12
great. I would say make your best selection here and then the approver can still take a look at that just to verify it. Um if they're unsure though or if
31:20
you really just want to make sure that the approver is the one that's handling that. Uh some clients like toh create a
31:26
placeholder cost code similar to this one down here just 999. Um, that way we can have something to enter and we we're
31:32
able to get all the required fields in that we need. Um, but you know, your approver can still see that and right
31:38
away they'll know that they need to change that to something more realistic. Um, so keep that in mind for really any
31:44
fields that are required that your AP AP person would be unsure of, uh, you can
31:49
always set up these kind of placeholder items. For the cost class, if you want a placeholder, I would say that would just
31:55
be number seven, your other cost class. So, we'll grab that. And now, at this point, before I save
32:01
the invoice, this is where I have to decide if I want to route the invoice for approval. If I don't, obviously,
32:06
I'll just save it, keep moving on with my day. But if I do want to route it, I'm going to come up here and click this little green arrow button. That is
32:13
essentially saying I want to send it to someone else. And when you click it, it's going to highlight it. So, when it's highlighted, that means that this
32:19
invoice is set to be routed when we save it. Now, if I do that by mistake, it's pretty easy to just click it again.
32:25
It'll turn that back off. I'm going to leave it on here while I click okay to save this record.
32:34
Oh, and you know what? I'm sorry. Before I route that for approval, it would probably be helpful for the approver if
32:39
they can actually look at the invoice that they're receiving. Um, so I am going to use our import images button
32:44
again here, and we're going to go ahead and attach one of our invoice files from our batch screen.
32:52
All
33:12
right. Now, I did close my window earlier and I'm opening it back up, so I have to reopen my batch. That's kind of
33:18
another benefit to if you just keep the window open on a second monitor, your batch will stay up for you. And then
33:24
I'll say this is my um my invoice just invoice here. So I'm going to drag it
33:29
over to get it attached. And let's you know if any of these applied again this is where we would
33:35
attach it. So I'll just act like this is a subcontract invoice so we can get a label on this one too. And we see that
33:40
pop up in the bottom right here. So now I could close this or minimize it. I'll just minimize it for right now.
33:47
we get our little file cabinet icon. That's perfect. And we've already got it turned on to route it to someone for
33:53
approval. So, next up, we're just going to click okay here. Now, if we have it uh set to be routed
33:59
for approval, we get this routing popup window. And again, this is just when we're manually routing an invoice. Um
34:05
but when we do this, we get to choose uh who the recipients are going to be in this top section here. Now, if we just
34:11
want to send this to one person, I could add user here. And I can just pick the recipient from the list of users. And
34:18
these are foundation users. So, to be an approver, you will have to have access to Foundation and have a user profile
34:24
set up for you. Um, but you know, in this case, if I wanted to send to Paul the PM, I can choose him and click okay
34:29
here. And then it lists him just to show us that it's going to be routed to that person.
34:35
Um, now I can remove that as well, which I'm going to do here.
34:40
And our second option is that we can add a group of users. Now, this would be what we want to do if we want multiple
34:45
people to approve something, which is something that we can support. Although, I will say it tends to be a lot more straightforward if we just send
34:51
something to a single approver. Um, and that's also seems to be the most common thing that we run into. So, that's what
34:57
we'll be looking at today. Now, if we were going to add a whole group of people, uh, we can come here and we can
35:02
add user. And again, we can just choose our recipients. Only this time, we can choose multiple people. So I can choose
35:08
my DBA and Paul the PM.
35:14
Um now at the bottom here when we add a group we get an option uh to decide if all of the recipients need to approve
35:21
this record before it's finalized or if any of the recipients can approve this record before it's finalized.
35:28
Now the difference between those two is if we choose the first option here which is selected and all recipients need to
35:33
approve the record. Uh if DBA chooses to approve the record, but Paul the PM
35:38
hasn't done anything with it yet, it's not going to be able to get posted at that point. So if we choose all
35:43
recipients must approve this record, that means that all of the recipients listed here need to go into Foundation,
35:49
open up document imaging, and click that approve button uh before that invoice will be able to continue through the
35:54
rest of the workflow in AP. Now, if you choose any recipient can approve this record, it's going to send
36:00
it to both of these people or all of these people in some cases. Um but then any one of those people could go into
36:06
Foundation and approve this record and that would um you know send it on through the rest of the workflow and
36:11
allow it to get processed normally. Um so just a little bit of difference between those two.
36:17
Now for this one I am just going to add a single user and we're going to route it to Paul the PM here.
36:25
Now in the bottom half of this popup window uh we also have a notes section, an email section, and a label section.
36:33
Um, so the notes are somewhat self-explanatory. It's just an area where we can put any special notes that
36:38
we might want the approver to see. Um, these notes get saved in the sticky note section. So, I'm not sure if anyone is
36:45
using these two buttons up here that look like little pieces of paper, but if we save these notes, they do get saved
36:50
here as well. So, you can open them up and view them in foundation when you need to. Um, but they also get shown on
36:55
the um the approval screen that we're going to be looking at. So, your PMS would also be able to view these notes.
37:02
Um, an example of a note that you might want to make would be like, "Hey, double check the cost code for me if you're unsure about the cost code." Just
37:09
anything like that that you might want them to look a little closer into or just review extra at all.
37:15
We also have an email template that we can choose from. Currently, I've only got the default template set up here.
37:20
Uh, this would be for email notifications, and we're going to talk about that towards the end today, just some of the different options we have
37:25
for notifications because we there's a couple ways to go about that. And then at the very bottom here, we've
37:31
got a routing label. And this is similar to the labels that we attach to your images. Um, but this is a label that um
37:38
really just gets sent to the approver. So, this isn't necessarily going to attach to a document. Um, but you can set up uh different types of labels for
37:45
different things. And um an example of a common one would be like setting up a label for double-checking your cost
37:51
code. And when we create these labels, we get to choose a little icon and give it a little description. And that would
37:57
just make it so that you know that one icon that we use to represent needing to check the cost codes. Anytime your
38:03
approver is is looking at their list of entries and they see that icon, they'll know for sure that they need to look at
38:08
that one a little bit closer than the rest of them. Now, for this one, I'm going to just say
38:13
that uh this is a subcontractor invoice uh so that we can see where those labels show
38:20
up. All right. Now, at this point, I'm ready to hit save and route. So, I'll do that
38:26
now. And then now that invoice is sent off. It's waiting for Paul to get into
38:32
Foundation when he's able to and approve it. Um, and at this point, there's really nothing else that uh we can do to
38:39
move that invoice forward in the uh in the workflow as an AP person that is.
38:44
Um, so, you know, we can't post those invoices when they're pending approval.
38:50
uh we the only thing we really would be able to do with those invoices at this point would be to modify them and pull
38:56
them back out of the routing process. So if we maybe enter an invoice and right away we realize shoot I made a mistake
39:02
on that. Let me fix that because I don't want Paul to see it. Uh you are able to go into modify mode here.
39:09
These would be unposted invoices. So I'm going to stick with that. And then I would need the transaction number. So
39:14
I'll click my little search button again and retrieve. and we'll pull up uh
39:19
number 113 here. Now, when we try to modify an invoice
39:24
that we've already routed for approval, we're going to get this popup message. And this is just saying it's it's letting us know that this is something
39:31
that is pending approval at the moment. And we've got two options. If we say yes here, it's going to retract that invoice
39:37
and remove it from the pending queue so that Paul won't see it anymore. Um whereas and at that point, we'd be able
39:43
to modify it, make any changes, and then just resend it for approval. Uh the other option would be to say no and just
39:49
leave that invoice in the approval queue and leave it as it is and let Paul take care of whatever error we may have made.
39:56
Um now in this case I am going to say yes. We'll pull that back. You can see it unlocks all these fields that were
40:01
grayed out. So now I can go in and I can make whatever changes I needed to. Like maybe this was supposed to be $2,000
40:07
instead of $1,000. You can see the file cabinet still
40:13
there. We still got our image attached. And then I will need to turn this back on since we're manually routing these
40:18
invoices at the moment. And when I click okay again, I can just add Paul back to the list and get that sent off to him.
40:29
Put my label back on and then save and routes.
40:35
And that will do it. Now, one of the common questions that we get is or common scenarios that we come
40:42
across, I should say, is we'll we'll be talking with someone that is having a hard time finding their invoice. Um, and
40:48
maybe they they're not sure who is supposed to approve it. They're not sure if it's approved or posted or whatever
40:54
else. Um, so even though we can't post those invoices, uh, we can still see
41:00
them on some of our reports just to be able to keep track of them and, you know, look into who we need to reach out
41:05
to to have them take action on something that we're waiting for. Um, so I'm going to show you two options for how we can
41:10
do that. Our first option is going to be uh, from this invoice window, we can go
41:16
to the invoice list screen where you would normally list and post an AP entry.
41:21
And there's some criteria here at the very bottom where we can choose to look at invoices in routing mode. So if I
41:27
turn that on, I know all my entries are pending right now. So I'll I'll stick with that. But you could also look for any other types of entries as well. And
41:34
then when I hit list, it should show me all those pending entries.
41:40
There we go. Uh so there's our two invoices that we had manually routed for approval. And
41:47
um with this, it tells us who it's awaiting approval from so that we can kind of look into who we need to reach out to and ask to to take action on it.
41:55
So that's going to be one option. Now, when we're in this screen, we still can't post it. So that still stands. Um if they're pending, we're not going to
42:01
be able to post them until they get approved. Um now, another option to look at these uh invoices that are already in
42:08
routing mode is going to be a report. And this is an accounts payable report. So, I'm going to come up here to our AP
42:14
report section, and we've got our routing history report
42:21
in the second category under invoice reports. Now, if we pull this one up, I'll show you this one briefly, too.
42:27
This one does have a lot more detail. Um, and you would want to be a little more cautious with what criteria you use
42:33
because this will show you invoices that are unposted, but also ones that are already posted. So, we just want to keep
42:39
an eye on that, right? because if you leave all this criteria blank a year after you start using document imaging
42:45
you're probably going to get hundreds of pages of invoices that have gone through the system so far.
42:50
Um now for today I don't really have a whole lot out there. So I am just going to hit report and we'll take a look at everything
42:57
and here are our two entries again. Uh so it does tell us that Paul is the last
43:02
person that's received the invoice. So that would kind of indicate that he's the one that needs to take action on it. Uh the nice thing with this report
43:08
though is it shows us a little bit more of the history. So it shows us who it's coming from and to and um we can kind of
43:14
backtrack that in case there was any issues along the way. Um and then the criteria to point out on
43:20
this the main one would just be the status. You know, depending on what you're looking for, you might change these statuses uh to narrow that that
43:27
list down so that you're seeing what you need. Okay.
43:32
Going to close out here as well. I do want to get into like looking at things from the PM's point uh perspective or
43:39
the approver's perspective. But before we get to that, I also want to talk about the second option for routing
43:44
invoices, which is going to be routing rules. Um automated invoice routing.
43:50
Um so to set that up, uh we're going to go to the control files down here. And if you ever try to go to these controls
43:56
and they're locked like this, you've got one of two things going on. Um the first thing might just be that you don't have
44:01
permission to access control files. um that will lock it. And if that's the case, you would just need to go work
44:07
with one of your database administrators to either get access or have them help you set this up. Um another reason that
44:13
this can lock though is if you have any open windows. It's not going to let you into the control files. So, I'm going to go come up here and just close all my
44:20
windows for now.
44:30
And then now you can see that unlocks. We're going to pull up our controls.
44:36
In these control files, obviously, we got a bunch of different stuff, but if we look towards the bottom here, there
44:42
is a routing rules control file, and this is rules for the the routing of those AP voices. So, we're going to pull
44:48
this up. We'll start talking about some of the options to set this up.
44:55
Now, the screen can be uh a little intimidating when you first look at it, but the best way to think about this this screen is that we're we're creating
45:02
rules here. And to really understand what rules we're creating, I would say you want to try to read this this screen
45:09
left to right, top to bottom as a sentence. Now, that may be kind of goofy sometimes. Um, so another way to explain
45:15
this is that we're setting up an if then statement. And that just means that if all the criteria that we choose in this
45:22
first section is met, then we're going to automatically route this invoice to whatever person we choose in this bottom
45:28
section. Um, so I'll just kind of walk through some of these rules and show you some of the different options. If we're setting
45:35
up something that needs to be approved, we're going to want to say whenever a record gets added,
45:40
and then we can choose to um, you know, do only records of specific types. Um,
45:46
so if I leave this at any in the drop down, it's just going to route any invoices that get added so far uh to
45:51
whatever person we choose at the bottom. But if I want to narrow that down and maybe send some invoices to one person
45:56
and some invoices to another person, I can choose to select specific types of records and then choose what I want to
46:03
refer to. Um, so in common one really common one is going to be project manager. So I'll choose project manager
46:10
here. Um, now if I want to route records that are related to a specific PM, then
46:15
I don't want to choose any values. I want to say selected values. And then I'll have a list of my PMs here that I
46:22
can choose from. And I can pick which one I'm setting up a rule from or for. So I'm going to choose Paul here.
46:30
And so so far with this, it's going to it's going to say whenever a record is added that is related to a project
46:36
manager of Paul, then we're going to route to whatever user we choose at the bottom here. because we haven't set
46:42
anything up here yet. Um, so this these two kind of go hand inand together. Whatever you choose here is going to
46:48
help you to narrow down the selection of invoices in this second section. And if we're routing by PM, it's going to look
46:54
very very similar to what we have here. Um, and just for the record, this project manager that we're referring to,
47:01
this is um this is referring to a project manager field on the general tab of your job records.
47:08
Now, some of the other options that we have down below is, you know, maybe we've got administrators that sometimes
47:14
enter invoices or maybe PMs sometimes enter invoices themselves and when they're doing the entries, we don't need
47:20
them to get approved. We can just post them right away. Now, if that's the case and it's not all invoices that need to
47:26
get approved, then we would want to add some extra criteria here, maybe to choose which users that enter invoices
47:32
are going to require approval. So, you know, I could say, um, our AP entry person requires approval, but no one
47:39
else does. That's what this is going to accomplish. Uh, and then I could also come down to this next section and
47:45
choose to only require approval for invoices of a certain dollar amount. U,
47:50
so, you know, maybe if it's an invoice is under $50, I'm not as worried about approving it. You know, I might say
47:56
anything greater than $50 is going to need to get approved here.
48:02
Um, and then our last option at the bottom is going to be who the actual approver is. And I'm going to choose
48:08
Paul for this one. Um, now again, we can choose multiple recipients, in which case we'd have to choose from these
48:13
options at the bottom here. Um, where either all of the recipients need to approve something or any of those people
48:19
can approve something. Um, but the most common thing and the thing that tends to work the best is going to be sending to
48:25
to one person here. Um, now if we look at this just everything we've entered here so far.
48:31
are now we're saying whenever a record is added that's related to a PM that is Paul and is entered by our AP entry
48:39
person uh for an amount that's greater than $50, then we're going to route to Paul the PM.
48:46
And that would be it for Paul's rule. That would get him all set up. Now, a lot of times you might have
48:52
multiple PMs. Maybe you want to have one PM approve their own invoices, like each PM approve their own items essentially.
48:59
Um, so what we're looking at right now, we've all we've just been working on rule number one. Um, but in the bottom,
49:05
we've got some extra buttons here where we can add new rules, we can delete rules, and then of course we can save
49:10
our changes. Um, so if I add a new rule here, it just gives me rule two at the top. And it's just a new blank slate
49:17
where I can go in and again say whenever something is added uh related to project
49:22
managers or whatever else you may want to use here. And just choose a different PM on this
49:28
one. Maybe we'll stick with the same criteria here.
49:36
And then this one would route to a different user, which I don't have set up as a user at the moment, but um that
49:42
is what it would end up looking like. Um now, if we set something up, we make
49:47
a mistake, we also have the ability to disable it. Um now, if we made a mistake
49:52
or just wanted to delete it altogether, we could delete the rule. But there may be times where it gets a little busy or
49:57
maybe someone doesn't have time to approve it. So you could also disable things and then turn them back on when you're ready to. Um especially if
50:04
someone's like maybe going on vacation so they won't be available to approve anything. Uh that can be very useful.
50:10
U if we do decide to only have approvals be required for certain users when we
50:16
choose these users. We also get these little gear icons that we can click on that will give you some extra options.
50:23
Uh, and I'll let you take a look at these real quick. Um, these are options just to decide if this user is going to
50:30
be allowed to maybe bypass the routing rules. And with this checkbox on, they can remove the recipient. So they could
50:37
take Mike Basil off of that routing and then put someone else in in place of it. Uh, so if we don't want them to be able
50:42
to do that, we would need to turn this off so that they cannot remove recipients from that routing dialogue.
50:48
U, they can add recipients. You know, we get to control whether or not they can do that. Um, just some some kind of
50:53
general settings here.
50:59
All right. Now, I'm going to go ahead and just stick with the one rule that we have to start with for now. Our rule
51:05
number one where we're routing to Paul the PM. And we're going to go enter some invoices for one of Paul's jobs. So, we
51:12
can start to see what that automated routing looks like. So, I'm going to save my changes,
51:17
and then we're going to close out of this window.
51:25
All right. So, going back to AP Daily here, we're going to enter another invoice.
51:53
All right. So, I'm just going to go through another invoice entry here. Uh, we'll go with Concrete Pete for this
51:58
one. I'm going to choose a job. Um, now I've already ensured that my jobs have
52:04
Paul set up as the project manager. Um, so I'm going to choose my budgeted job here. We'll go through and and we'll say
52:11
this is a concrete sub, for example. Get your number entered. get your date
52:19
and then we'll have this be 25 24. Now, right away, you'll notice when I
52:25
chose this job that that green routing button, it's already turned on. Um, so that's just going to be done
52:30
automatically for us now that we have those rules set up. Um, but I'm going to click okay to continue validating this
52:36
record. Um, and again here, I'll just remind you, we do have to enter all the required fields still. You can see it's
52:42
not letting me save this without my normally required items. Um, so having the routing rules uh does not does not
52:48
allow us to get around any of that.
52:54
Some of that default in. And I'm going to go ahead and choose my my uh oh, this is a budgeted job. So I
53:01
will just choose our concrete cost code cost class of subs. And we should be
53:07
good to go. I'm also going to come up here to the top, click my import images button. So I did close out of that. That
53:14
way we can get an invoice attached to this.
53:40
All right. Grab my batch folder here.
53:49
And we'll grab this last invoice.
53:58
All right, I'll minimize this one again. We get our file cabinet icon. So, we
54:03
know that's been attached at this point. And now we are ready to save this.
54:12
Now, this time around, it's still giving us that same dialogue for routing. Um, so you can see it pulled it up, but this
54:17
time we've got PM already selected here. That's Paul's user, so he's already set up and good to go. Um, and when we've
54:24
got it set up to be automated, the only thing we would need to worry about at this point is if we need to give them any special notes or if we wanted to
54:29
attach a label to this at all. Otherwise, I'll just click save and
54:34
route. And that one is now off to the races. It's also in that workflow waiting for Paul to take care of it.
54:42
Now, while I'm still on this invoice window, I want to talk about something that is a little bit miscellaneous
54:47
before we switch over to act like Paul, the project manager, and see what that that side of things looks like. Um, so
54:54
on your, this is again just something that would be important for your AP invoice people. Uh, and when we're
54:59
entering an AP invoice, I'm just going to start a little fake one here. On the additional tab, you've got this field
55:05
here for scanned invoice image. Um, and this is something that would allow you to choose a file path and it would save
55:12
that file path here. Uh, but this is not document imaging. Um, and that's very important to keep in mind because when
55:18
we when we use this field, all it's doing is saving that file path um as a
55:23
link so that when I come here and click this open button, it'll open up that file path on the computer that you're
55:29
currently on. Um, and in theory would open up the image because it'll be saved wherever you had, you know, entered that
55:35
file path from. Um, now this is entirely separate from document imaging. Um, and
55:40
this is just not a very good option to use. Um, especially because if you, let's say, I attach an image that I had
55:46
saved to my desktop or I link it here, I should say, and then someone else from their own computer goes in and tries to
55:52
open up that image, it's not going to work because that file doesn't exist on their computer. And again, this isn't
55:58
actually saving the image to your database. This is just saving that file path as a link that you can open up. Um,
56:04
so just keep that in mind. I've seen a couple of clients where they got a little bit mixed up with this button
56:09
compared to this field right here um and had all their images getting attached here instead and um it's just it's not
56:16
ideal. You know, we can't search for these images. We won't always be able to open them. So, we really really want to stick with this import images button at
56:22
the very top here. Uh and if you don't get that that import images uh separate window, then then we're we're not on the
56:28
right track. So, we'd want to, you know, look for some help there. Um all righty.
56:35
Now, with all that being said, u at this point, you know, we've done a couple examples of entering an invoice, getting
56:41
it sent off to your approvers so that they can take a look at that and handle it however they might need to. Um, so
56:46
I'm going to switch over to a different user now. We're going to sign in as Paul the PM.
56:52
Close out of this here. All right. So, again, over in the top
56:58
left here, just to point it out, we are signed in as Paul the PM now. And so from a project manager's point of view
57:05
or whoever is going to be approving the invoices, uh they're going to come in when they need to take action on something. And
57:11
from the main menu, they're going to need access to this document imaging function.
57:17
Now, if we pull this up, uh this is what they're going to want to do if they're coming in to take action on something. They'll open this up and they'll be able
57:23
to see a list of all their items that are, you know, related to their user.
58:07
There we go. Came over to my other monitor. Give me one moment. I'll drag it over.
58:19
Now, this is another pop-up window. This one is very different from the import images window that we've been looking at, though. Uh, this one is called the
58:25
daily document manager.
58:43
Oh, I opened a couple of them by mistake.
58:54
All right, pull this over. Okay, so this is our daily document manager.
59:00
And this is this is the view that your PMS are going to be most familiar with. This is always where they're going to be coming to to use document imaging, get
59:07
the approvals in. Um, which I'm sorry, I keep saying PMs. I should be saying approvers because it may not be PMS for
59:12
all of you. But um now with this again, this this window is actually pretty customizable.
59:18
Um and I'll just talk through some of the different parts and pieces that we're looking at here. Um we do have a
59:25
main window again, which is a separate window from Foundation. We can see um and within this this main daily document
59:32
manager window, we've got some sub windows that we can drag around and rearrange. Although with this one, the defaults aren't are pretty good. You
59:38
know, we get a nice size preview over here. So, we can look at the invoice, we can zoom in on it and compare that to what was entered, verify all the
59:45
information. Um, and then if there's multiple pages for an invoice, which again, not super common, we would be
59:50
able to uh, you know, page through each of them down at the bottom here. Now, over on the left, we've got a
59:56
section of AP invoices. Um, and these are all the items that have been sent either to or from whatever user we're
1:00:02
signed in as. In this case, it's for Paul. And this w this section in particular is
1:00:07
something that is very customizable. So, we'll take some time to look at some of those options. Uh, one of the first customization options you'll get though
1:00:14
is at the bottom you've got different views. Um, and actually, let me switch over here. By default, you're going to
1:00:21
be coming in and and seeing any time as the view. And this is just going to show you anything that has been sent or
1:00:28
received, you know, at any time. Um, but we can also come in here and we can click this little green plus button and
1:00:34
we can create additional views. And this is going to be pretty important because the default views are going to
1:00:40
show you things that were sent and received. They're going to show you all the statuses. It's just going to show you everything,
1:00:45
which is not ideal because we really as a as an approver, we really don't want
1:00:50
to see the things that we've already approved and sent back to accounts payable um because we don't need to do anything else with those ones. So, it'll
1:00:57
just kind of clutter things up. Um, so especially as an approver, one of the first things you'll want to do is create
1:01:02
one of these views and then come up here and choose to only see things that were received and then only see things that
1:01:09
are pending. And that's just going to narrow the list down so that you're only seeing a list
1:01:15
of items that you need to take action on. Um, so we'll also give this a name at the very top here. I'll call this
1:01:21
field view 2. It'll be the same thing, but that's okay. Um, and then as we keep moving down this list, we can control
1:01:28
the time frame we want to look at. And with something like this view where we're we're seeing everything we need to take action on. You know, it shouldn't
1:01:34
really matter if it's from last week or last month. We really want to see everything that we need to take action on so we can make sure we're handling
1:01:40
those. And then if we wanted to, we can choose to narrow it down by who's routed the document or what type of document it
1:01:47
was. But I'll leave that up to you guys. Just save this.
1:01:55
All right. Now, across the top of the screen, we've got another ribbon with some different
1:02:01
options and and actions that we can take. Um, as an approver, the the main buttons that you're going to need to
1:02:07
worry about are going to be these first three here. Um, these are where we can take action and actually process
1:02:12
something with document imaging. Um, and so we can go through and you can see there's three items that are pending
1:02:18
currently. So, these are all ones that we need to to do something with and get sent back to accounts payable. Um, and
1:02:24
if we select these items, uh, it highlights it in yellow just so we know which one we're working on. And then we
1:02:30
get our preview over on the right. So, we can take a look at that, just kind of compare the details. Um, and when we
1:02:36
just have one line like this, there's not a whole lot of detail here. Um, so we can also click the little plus button
1:02:41
for each row and it'll expand it and show us the the distribution, the bottom section of those AP invoices. And this
1:02:48
is where we can go through and double check our job numbers, our cost code numbers, dollar amounts, all that good
1:02:54
stuff. Um, so you know, as an approver, you'd be comparing these things and then if it's good to go, you might approve it
1:03:01
and that's just going to if you approve something, it's going to mark that as approved and send it back to your
1:03:06
accounts payable person and then your AP person would then be able to go into foundation and post that entry. So that
1:03:12
would be kind of finalizing it. Um the reject option is going to mark it
1:03:17
as rejected of course and if we reject something uh it's it really means that
1:03:23
we're not able to do anything else with that invoice. So if we reject it it is going to get sent back to your AP
1:03:28
person. Uh but the only option that your AP person is going to have with that invoice is going to be to delete it. Um
1:03:35
so because of that the reject option it's kind of situational. It's not a very common one that people use. Uh the
1:03:42
I would say the most common use for it would be if if there was a duplicate entry that somehow got entered or uh if
1:03:48
you really just decided to to cancel a purchase and you're you're not going to be needing that invoice anymore.
1:03:55
Um now our third option here is revise. And if we revise an invoice, we're able
1:04:00
to make changes to anything in this distribution section on the invoice. You update all the job costing and whatnot.
1:04:06
Um, and then when we're done making those changes, we could send that revised invoice back to your AP person,
1:04:13
uh, who could, you know, review any changes that you suggested and take action on them and then after that be
1:04:18
able to get the invoice listed and posted to finalize it. Um, now with those three options,
1:04:24
approve is pretty straightforward and reject is one that doesn't get used very often. Um, the revise option though, I
1:04:30
do want to talk about a little bit more here. uh mainly to explain that if if we are an approver and we decide to revise
1:04:38
an invoice uh making a revision on an invoice which we can actually look at that now. Let's go ahead and revise one
1:04:44
of these here. See, we'll revise this one that had our kind of generic cost
1:04:49
code. Um so if I select this this pending item, I can click revise here.
1:04:55
Then it gives me this new revision section at the bottom of my list of invoices. And this is where I can go in
1:05:01
and and these fields are going to act very similar to foundations fields where I can click um see a drop-own list and
1:05:07
choose a different job or in this case I need to choose a different cost code. I'll make this one demolition for
1:05:14
example. And then I'll update my cost class as well.
1:05:20
And if I needed to, I could change any of this stuff. You know, I could change the GL account. Uh I could update the
1:05:25
dollar amount if if it got mistyped or anything. and just do whatever I need to. Um, I could also add a whole new
1:05:31
distribution row if I needed um and fill out additional job costs. You know, maybe this $2,000 needed to get split up
1:05:37
between a couple of rows. Um, so you also have the ability to do that as well.
1:05:43
Now, the big thing I want to explain with u making revisions here though is when we're when we're revising an
1:05:48
invoice in this screen as an approver, um we want to think about this almost like if you were to receive a paper copy
1:05:54
of the invoice and you write down your suggested changes on that paper copy and
1:06:00
then send it back to your AP person to make those changes and then get it posted. And the reason I say that is
1:06:06
because when we change these items here, uh you know, I updated our cost code, updated our cost class, uh those changes
1:06:13
are not going to happen automatically in foundation. Um your AP person would still need to be um going into that
1:06:20
invoice. They would they would see a list of the re revisions you made and they would just have an option to apply
1:06:25
those revisions uh which would update everything and then they'd be ready to move on. Um, but because of that that
1:06:31
process there where your AP person has to kind of apply those revisions and and get it posted, um, the AP person in
1:06:37
theory could choose to to, you know, change it to something else. Um, so really it's just your suggestions for
1:06:43
your AP team. Um, and then they they will have the last kind of touch on the
1:06:48
invoice uh before it gets posted. Now, in this case, I've already made my
1:06:54
changes. So, I'm going to go come down to the bottom. I'm going to save and route this entry.
1:07:02
And by default, it is always going to route back to the user that originally sent it to you. Um, which in most cases
1:07:09
is going to be your AP person, and that's what we would want. Um, if we did want someone else to take a look at
1:07:14
this, maybe we can also choose to route it to a different user or a different group of users. U, but again, the most
1:07:20
common thing is just going to be sending it back to that AP person so they can they can take action on it from there.
1:07:26
Um, now as the approver, you can also make notes again here. So, if there's anything you want to send back to that
1:07:32
approver, um, you know, fixed cost code that might not be super necessary, but anything that might be important for
1:07:37
them to see before they post the invoice, this would be a great place to put it. And then when I click okay at
1:07:42
the bottom here, uh, it's going to send that off to the AP entry person to finish it up.
1:07:51
All right.
1:07:56
Give me a moment. There we go. All right. Now, now that I've approved that, or actually in that case, I revised it
1:08:03
and then sent it back to AP, you can see that entry has fallen off my list here because I no longer need to take action
1:08:08
on it. Um, and that is because I'm on field view 2. Now, here, that custom one that we set up. Um, I just want to point
1:08:15
out again, the default is going to be anytime. And so if if your approvers are coming to you and they're saying, "Hey,
1:08:21
you know, I'm it's tough for me to find the things I actually need to approve because I'm seeing a bunch of old stuff that I don't need to do anything with,
1:08:28
um, right away, that's an indicator that we need to to get in and set them up with a better view format so that they
1:08:34
can get rid of all those ones that they've been sent because they just don't need them anymore.
1:08:40
All right. Now, I'm going to switch back here to field view number two.
1:08:52
Okay. Now, with this first one for our concrete Pete vendor, um, actually, you
1:08:59
know what? Before I I get into that here, some of I want to go through some of the other customization options that you get, uh, when you're looking at this
1:09:06
screen. And, um, one of the big things you can do is you can rearrange all these
1:09:11
columns. Um, so for example, the transaction number, you know, as an approver, you might not be as concerned
1:09:16
about that. Um, so you can move that over here to the right hand side so that the information that you are more
1:09:22
worried about is just, you know, closer to the forefront. So you can see all that. Another option is if you
1:09:28
rightclick these columns, you can remove this column al together if you wanted to and just, you know, have less clutter to
1:09:35
distract you or confuse you at all. Um, and then if you rightclick any of these columns, you can also choose the field
1:09:42
chooser option. And this is how we can decide if we wanted to add columns back in. Like I I remove that transaction
1:09:49
number. You know, if that was a mistake, I wanted to bring it back. I would rightclick field chooser and then I
1:09:54
could scroll down and look for that transaction number again to get it added back in.
1:10:02
And there we go. Um, but the same thing can be done with any of these other fields, right? So, as an approver, if
1:10:07
there's other items from that invoice that you think would be helpful to to review and just verify as you're going
1:10:14
through this process, um definitely take a look through this and you know, maybe you want to get your due date over there or your discounts information. Um very
1:10:21
very customizable as far as what information you get to see at the forefront here.
1:10:29
Um now, another option that you have with this is um you can drag these columns and you can drag them up to the
1:10:35
very top. this little gray section here. And if you do that, it's going to sort the list that you're looking at by
1:10:41
whatever column you put in the top. So, with approvers or especially if your PMs
1:10:47
are your approvers, the job number is a pretty popular one because then, you know, you're still only going to see
1:10:53
your jobs as a PM. Um, but you'd be able to see each invoice uh separated out based on what job it's a part of. So,
1:10:59
maybe you go through and approve one job at a time or whatever else you may want to do. Um, and that can be done for all
1:11:06
kinds of things, right? So, I could sort by job up there. I could sort by job name if you're more familiar with the
1:11:11
name of a job. Uh, I could sort by vendor. Lots of flexibility with that
1:11:17
one as well. Uh, the only item that sorting doesn't work great on is going to be this
1:11:23
received on field. Um, because if we drag this up here, it actually sorts by the time as well. So, that one is not
1:11:30
ideal. we wouldn't really want to use that one as our our main header sort. But and actually while we're talking
1:11:35
about that field, I'll also point out that you can resize these fields too. Um so if something is getting cut off like
1:11:41
your vendor name or anything, you can give yourself a little more space with it. Um but also with like this received
1:11:46
on, you know, you may not be worried about the time. So you could also shrink it to where you're just seeing the date
1:11:52
so that again there's just a little bit less clutter on this window.
1:11:57
Okay. Um, now I'm going to we've we've gone through a revision. Um, I am going to re I'm going to approve one of these
1:12:05
invoices and I'm going to reject the other just so we can kind of see all three of those processes. Um, not only
1:12:11
from the PM's point of view, but also when we go back to your AP uh point of view and see what that looks like. Uh so
1:12:17
with this first one, we'll go ahead and approve that,
1:12:22
which again, normally, you know, you'd want to expand it, compare it to the image, and assuming it's all correct.
1:12:28
Then we come up here and we get it approved,
1:12:45
right? And then and as you can see that was pretty straightforward. It's just another one of those routing dialogues.
1:12:50
Nothing too fancy with that. And then the reject is going to be very similar. So again I select it. This time I
1:12:56
realize, oh no, that's not the right invoice. We need to get rid of this one. It just needs to be deleted. Um so I'm
1:13:01
going to come up and choose to reject. Once again we get our little routing dialogue. And then I'll I wanted notes I
1:13:08
could. But in this case I'll just click okay.
1:13:16
And if we're coming in here as an approver especially and we see that we've got a blank screen that means we are all caught up. There's nothing else
1:13:22
that's waiting for you as long as we've got our view correctly.
1:13:27
All right. So now I am going to be coming back here because there are some other things on this window that you can do. Um but I think for right now we're
1:13:35
going to get out of this window. We're going to go back and act like an AP person again and we're going to see what it looks like from their end. uh once
1:13:42
the approver has taken action on these items. So, I'm going to close out
1:13:47
and switch back over to our AP person. Perfect.
1:13:54
I'm going to close out of this window.
1:14:06
All right. Now, as an AP person, actually, I guess I can show you a couple of things here.
1:14:13
Um the first thing I'll show you is in enter invoices, uh once once your PM or
1:14:18
your approver marks something as approved, it's going to be ready to post. um as soon as that happens. Um so
1:14:25
if it does just get approved, it's not rejected, it's not revised at all, um the next time you go to list and post
1:14:32
all your your unposted entries, depending on the criteria you use, it
1:14:37
would just be included with whatever else is pending here. So I'll show you that here.
1:14:47
Now, I did have some other test invoices, but down at the bottom, this is the one that we marked as approved. Uh, this was our concrete pete sub and
1:14:54
there it is, ready to get posted. So, if I click this button up top, we're good to go.
1:15:03
Um, now what's not listed here is your uh revised invoice. So if I come back to
1:15:09
my criteria here and I'll show you we'll include in routing mode and this time we'll look at revised entries
1:15:19
and we can see this one is still is still pending and that's because of that step I mentioned earlier where your AP
1:15:26
person actually needs to go in and apply those modifications. So that's why it's now saying that this is waiting for AP
1:15:32
entry as the user. Um, so now that's what we're going to look at next, kind of how to handle
1:15:37
those revised entries. And essentially what we need to do is we
1:15:43
need to uh go into AP invoices and go into modify mode and pull up the invoice
1:15:48
in modify mode that got revisions. And that's what's going to prompt the popup that allows us to automatically apply
1:15:54
those revisions. Um, now doing that, we can do it manually if we wanted to. Um,
1:16:00
but you may not have the transaction number that you're looking for on that invoice. Um, so just some other options
1:16:05
that you have to make that a little bit easier, you know, getting to that invoice and opening it up, uh, would be
1:16:10
going as the AP person still, uh, going to your your own daily document manager under document imaging.
1:16:18
Go ahead and pull this up here.
1:16:49
I'm going to give it a moment this time because last time I did open up two by mistake which caused even more delay.
1:17:01
There it comes.
1:17:07
me one moment and I'll pull that over for everyone.
1:17:35
All right. Okay. So now we are in our daily
1:17:40
document manager as our AP person. Um and I have already done a little bit of customization with the views and the
1:17:47
layouts on this. Um so to start I just want to show you some of the recommendations as an AP person for
1:17:53
these settings. Um, so again here, the view is going to be really important as an AP person because if we just stick
1:17:58
with anytime, uh, it's going to show us everything that they've sent, which I'm sure you can imagine would end up being
1:18:04
quite a bit of stuff over time. Um, and there's just a lot of stuff that they don't need to worry about there. So
1:18:09
that's why we want to set up a custom view. In this case, I named it to post. These are all the entries that we need
1:18:14
to post still. And I'll click this little gear icon
1:18:20
just to show you the settings that I used for that view. Um, again though, pretty straightforward. Just anything that was received in this case. Um, but
1:18:27
this time we've got more statuses enabled because, you know, we want to look at approved, revised, and rejected so that we can take action on those. Uh,
1:18:34
now pending actually we wouldn't really need here.
1:18:43
All right. Now, another thing I did on this uh this user is I grabbed the from column. So, this is the person that sent
1:18:49
it to me. And I drag that up as our header sort. Uh, and this is definitely
1:18:55
optional. It's preference here, but you know, this allows all the invoices that your AP person needs to get posted,
1:19:02
they'll get organized by the approver. Um, but you could also have them be organized by job or name and all kinds
1:19:08
of stuff there. Just whatever they prefer. Now if I expand my from PM section, these are all the invoices that I
1:19:15
received from Paul the PM. And um again here I can you know customize these
1:19:21
columns u more specifically as my as an AP entry person for stuff that's more important for me. Um and then when I'm
1:19:28
ready to you know take action on them, the best thing to do is going to be to click this little foundation icon. Uh
1:19:34
this is a link to actually open up that entry in Foundation. So like this revised entry for example, I'm going to
1:19:40
click on that icon and it's just automatically taking me
1:19:46
back to my foundation window and opening that up as we speak here.
1:20:37
All right, there we go. So now when it opens that up, this is the same thing that you would get if you just came here
1:20:43
manually and went into modify mode and typed in that transaction number manually. Um, keep that in mind because
1:20:48
that'll kind of play a part with some of the notification stuff I'm going to get into. Um, but you know, once we get it
1:20:54
pulled up, we've got our little pop-up window here, and it's showing us that distribution section. And if we scroll
1:21:00
through this, it's going to highlight in yellow any of the things that your approver made changes to, just to kind
1:21:05
of make sure you're aware of those changes. Um, but you'll notice like as your AP person, I could still come in
1:21:10
here and kind of choose what I wanted to. And, um, that just goes back to what I was saying earlier about how you want
1:21:16
to think about this as as your approvers just making notes and sending those to AP. Um, and then AP is are the ones that
1:21:22
are actually going to be applying those changes. Um, so I'm going to go ahead and just click apply revisions, though.
1:21:28
It makes that much quicker. Um, and actually, I'm sorry, I should also point this out. Um, you've got a view notes
1:21:33
button, and if this is in bold, that does mean there is a note to view. Um, so you can see when I open that up, it's
1:21:39
not as bold here for the text. Um, that's just a good indicator of if there's something you should look at or if you can just skip that step for this
1:21:46
one. Um, and then you can see the note that that your PE your uh approver had sent back to you. Fix the cost code.
1:21:52
Perfect. So, we'll close the notes. I'm going to apply the revisions here. You
1:21:58
can see it makes those changes for us. And then I can close out of this window al together. And then now I can click
1:22:04
okay at the top to save it with the changes. And since those changes were made already, it's not going to be
1:22:09
trying to to route it back to Paul even though that's, you know, the person on the job.
1:22:16
And once it is saved, we can go to our list and post window and that will show up ready to post.
1:22:26
Now I am going to come back to our document manager here for a second and look at this rejected entry next. Um,
1:22:33
and I'm going to go ahead and just do the same thing here. Select my rejected and then double click on my little Foundation logo to open that up in
1:22:39
Foundation.
1:23:03
All
1:23:15
right.
1:23:21
Now, with this one, when we pull it up again, we get this little pop-up message. It's a different one this time, of course. Um, and I will say this is
1:23:28
the same pop-up message you would get if you just manually came in here in modify mode and typed in transaction 108. Um,
1:23:35
but it's just telling us that this uh cannot be revised. It can only be deleted at this point. Um, so if I click
1:23:40
okay, you can see all these fields are locked. I can't change anything and resave it or anything like that. So the
1:23:46
only option I have really is to hit this reject or I'm sorry, hit this delete button and just remove it from the
1:23:51
system.
1:24:01
Now, as far as like the overall workflow for routing invoices for approval with
1:24:06
document imaging, um that is essentially it from start to finish. You know, you've got your AP person who's going to
1:24:12
make an entry. Uh they'll either choose who to route it to or have some rules set up that will automate that for them.
1:24:18
Um, from there, your approvers would need to sign into Foundation and open up document imaging, open up their daily
1:24:24
document manager, u, and take a look at anything they need to take action on and decide what's best for each of those
1:24:29
items. That will send it back to your AP person who can then also open up document imaging to look at the a list
1:24:36
of items they need to take action on and get handled from there.
1:24:41
Um, now with all this workflow, u, alerts and notifications can be very helpful. um you know getting a some sort
1:24:48
of message to let your approvers know when they actually need to go into foundation. Um especially depending on
1:24:54
the type of employee it is. They may not be in foundation on a regular basis. Um so that would just be extra important to
1:25:00
make sure they can get some sort of indicator to let them know when they need to sign in here um and look at this. So I'm going to talk about two
1:25:08
options. Again, lots of dual options with document imaging. Um, in this in this case, we're going to talk about two
1:25:13
different options for how we can kind of notify and alert these approvers and your AP people about when they need to
1:25:19
take action on something. Uh, first option I'll show you is going to be located in controls. Again, so again, to
1:25:26
get here, you'll need some administrative access and you'll need to have no open windows at the time. I'm
1:25:31
going to open this up and we're just going to scroll down to the document imaging controls in this case. Get that
1:25:37
pulled up.
1:25:44
All right. Now, there's some other settings here that I'll mention briefly in a moment, but down at the bottom, we've got some email templates. Um, and
1:25:51
these are templates that we can send as email notifications to um, anyone that's involved in the process really. Um, and
1:25:58
they are customizable. So, you know, we can have a different template depending on what status it is
1:26:03
that you're receiving. Um, so like for your approvers, it would be a lot of pending statuses. So that would be the
1:26:08
main template you need. Whereas for your AP person, uh you know, you might want to use all of these. And we'll kind of
1:26:14
talk about some tips with that. Um but with each of these templates, you can also customize them by clicking this
1:26:20
little icon on the right. And this is really just customizing the the email message that your approvers or
1:26:28
AP people would be receiving whenever um something with this status gets sent to them. Uh, so we can have multiple
1:26:34
templates um that can be chosen when you're actually routing the invoice. And you can choose what the subject is going
1:26:40
to be as well as what the body is going to be. Um, and with this first option I'm showing you, these these
1:26:45
notifications can be kind of nice uh because we can also insert merge fields is what they're called. And these are
1:26:52
fields that are going to pull information from the invoice that is being routed and just automatically
1:26:57
populate into the email notification that your approver would receive. Um, so
1:27:02
for example, if you wanted to say, you know, invoice number XYZ for job number XYZ has been
1:27:12
routed to you for approval. Uh, you know, that's not going to make a lot of sense to your approver at the moment. But if we highlight the the section of
1:27:19
text that needs to be replaced and then click this insert merge field at cursor,
1:27:25
it gives us a list of items that are on that AP invoice screen that we can choose from and just have automatically
1:27:31
populate before that message gets sent out. So in this case, this would be looking for invoice number. So I grabbed
1:27:37
invoice number here. And then I also want to include my job number to show them what job it's for.
1:27:43
So, I'd come in here again, insert merge field, and insert the job number. But you can see there's a lot of details
1:27:49
you can include here. Um, now this is this is one of the pros to this option
1:27:54
for notifications. But there is also a con here. Uh, if we went this route and
1:27:59
decided to to use this section to set up notifications for document imaging, it's going to be sending one email uh for
1:28:07
every single invoice that gets sent to each person. So, if you have one approver that receives uh that has 10
1:28:13
invoices that get created in a day, um that one approver is going to receive 10 separate emails so it can tell them
1:28:19
which numbers and and all that detail for them. Um now, some people are okay
1:28:24
with that. Um some people set up like filters on their their email application to send those all to a separate folder
1:28:30
and keep it organized. But I am going to be showing you another option that is not as frequent. So, uh just bear with
1:28:36
me there. Now, sticking with this option though, um if we were going this route, we would save this. We've got our little
1:28:42
template created now. But then we also need to decide who's going to receive these these notifications.
1:28:49
And to do that, we can go to this recipients tab on your control file. Now, this is where we can rightclick and
1:28:56
add lines. And then we could choose our user number. So, I'll choose Paul the PM. And then enter the email address
1:29:02
that we want his notifications to go to. Now, usually that would be Paul the PM's email address, right? So, we might do
1:29:08
Paul at Foundation. Uh, but then we can also add additional
1:29:13
emails if there's anyone else that you want to be included on those as well. Just keep in mind it is going to send one email for every single invoice.
1:29:20
Um, and you can add as many rows as you need here for as many people are going to uh that are going to be included in
1:29:26
that process. All right.
1:29:33
Um, now I'm going to cancel out. Actually, let me just delete that for now.
1:29:40
Now I'm going to close out of this window. That's that's essentially it. If we're going this route for notifications, we got to make sure your
1:29:46
templates are all created depending on which ones you want to use. And then we have to make sure this recipients tab is
1:29:51
filled out for the people that want to receive these notifications. And this is something you can you can do
1:29:56
a mixture of this notification process and the one that I'm about to explain to you. So, keep that in mind. If you think
1:30:02
there's some people that prefer the very detailed notifications, we can set that up for them and then go the other route
1:30:08
for anyone that does not like getting all those emails. Um, so yeah, I'm going to close out of
1:30:13
this window. We're going to start talking about the second option. And really the big uh the the main
1:30:18
reason that you would want to use this second option for notifications is going to be uh getting less frequent emails
1:30:26
about invoices that need approval. Um, and we can kind of control the frequency that you would get notifications when we
1:30:32
go this route. Uh, the downside is that we won't be able to include any of the invoice details. So, instead of getting
1:30:38
an alert that says, you know, invoice number XYZ for job number XYZ is ready
1:30:43
for approval, uh, you're just going to get a message that says, uh, you have invoices that are pending approval. Uh,
1:30:50
you know, please open foundation and take action on those. So, it'll just be a little bit more generic.
1:30:56
Um, now if we want to want to go that route, get less frequent emails that are a bit more generic, uh, we can go to
1:31:02
genies and then we're going to go to alert genies. So, I'm going to go ahead and open that
1:31:07
up real quick. And there's two types of alerts we can
1:31:13
create, but in this case, uh, we're talking about an AP routed documents alert. Um, now we would want to be
1:31:19
creating a new one. So, we would select that and then we can click okay in the top right to open up our setup window.
1:31:32
And now this screen, it might be a little confusing at first, but if you look on the left here, um especially when we're setting these up, um for just
1:31:39
kind of some basic notifications, um it's pretty straightforward. And what we're doing here is we're we're creating
1:31:44
a rule that says whenever this criteria uh that we create on the right side here gets met, then we're going to send an
1:31:51
email to the person that we choose in one of our next steps. Um so like the most straightforward way and definitely
1:31:57
the most common way that you would do this is you would say whenever something gets uh routed to a user and then we can
1:32:04
choose which user we want to set this up for. So, I'd say PM Paul.
1:32:10
Um, and that's it really. Just any anytime something gets routed to uh Paul the PM. And actually, I'm sorry, that's
1:32:16
not it. So, anytime something gets routed to Paul the PM with a status
1:32:22
of pending, that's what what's going to trigger our alert to get sent out.
1:32:27
Um, we could also do, you know, approved and revised for your AP person if you wanted to. So, they would only get notified if there's something they need
1:32:34
to post. Um, but you know, as an approver, you'd probably set it up this way where it's just anything that get is
1:32:39
pending and gets sent to me. I want to get an email about that. Um, and that's that would really be it
1:32:46
for this screen. So, then we would come down to the bottom and click next here. And this is where we get to add our
1:32:51
email recipients for when those criteria get met. Um, and again, here you can choose one person or multiple people
1:32:57
depending on who you want to receive these alerts. Um, and we're going to come up to the top and we're going to
1:33:03
choose which list we want to add email addresses from. Now, your your approvers
1:33:08
and your AP people are all going to be users. So, you could look at your users list and choose from that and then click
1:33:15
okay and it would it would add them down here. But you can also choose from employees
1:33:20
uh or PM contacts if you have the PM module. Um, so yeah, just to show you here. Oh,
1:33:26
I don't have any email addresses. Sorry. but it would just pull up any other employee records that have email addresses as well to choose from.
1:33:34
Um, now I'm good with it just getting sent to one person. So, I would say next again. And this is where I get to choose
1:33:39
the frequency. Now, the way this is going to work is when when someone signs into Foundation, the system is going to
1:33:45
do a check. It's going to it's going to look and see if those criteria are met. So, it's going to look at the the daily
1:33:50
document manager for Paul and it's going to see if there's any pending items on that daily document manager. And if
1:33:57
there is a a pending item, it's going to trigger the alert and it would either send that alert out once a day, once a
1:34:03
week, or once a month. Um, daily or weekly seem to be the most common. Uh, personally, I think daily is
1:34:10
best just so you're not having any delays with your AP process because if they're not doing it right away, it is going to uh prevent those entries from
1:34:17
getting posted. But that is certainly up to you. And then the range of recurrence
1:34:22
uh for something like this is is just going to be no end date. this is going to go on indefinitely as long as they're
1:34:27
having invoices get routed to them. And that's all we would do on this step.
1:34:32
So then we would come back down to the bottom and click next again. And this is where we get to choose what that email
1:34:38
uh notification is going to look like. Um so we can give it an alert description, you know, invoices, pending
1:34:45
approval, or whatever would make sense for them. and then give it a little body here and
1:34:50
say you have pending approval.
1:34:56
Please sign in to take action. Something along those lines. Uh the main thing to
1:35:02
notice here is that we don't have that option I was showing you to insert a merge field because this is this is
1:35:07
potentially going to be notifying someone about a bunch of different invoices. Uh so we're not able to pull in those details in the same way. Um,
1:35:15
now when we're doing the setup, we've also got some options at the bottom here that are pretty important. Um, this
1:35:20
first one is especially important. Uh, you know, this notification is not going to be very helpful if it just sends out
1:35:25
no matter what the results are. Um, so this box is going to make it so that if the criteria that we set up is not met,
1:35:32
it's not going to send out an alert. It's only going to send out the alert if you know there's something pending
1:35:37
waiting for them. Uh, there's a disable option if we wanted to turn it off. And then we can also choose to send a test
1:35:43
email alert when you save this record, which I'm going to skip that for today. Um, when you're setting it up for real
1:35:48
though, this is a good idea just to make sure you've got all the other email settings in place to have this work properly.
1:35:55
I'm going to go ahead and click finish on this one. And that would be it. That would be uh an alert for Paul, the PM,
1:36:02
all set up and ready to go. And the next time he's got invoices waiting, when the system does that check, it's going to
1:36:08
give him a notification that he needs to sign in and take care of them.
1:36:13
Now, with these alerts, um I'll call these the ones we just talked about. The second option is going to be alerts,
1:36:19
whereas the control file option, the first one we looked at are called notifications.
1:36:24
And so with the alerts that we set up under Genies here, there are some extra settings that we have to make sure get
1:36:30
turned on for these to work properly. Um, and one of the things I mentioned with these alerts is that when someone
1:36:35
signs into the system, it's going to do a check to see if those criteria get met. Um, but we actually have to choose
1:36:41
who that signs in is able to trigger the system to do that check. Um, which that
1:36:47
is in the security section here at the very bottom under system. So, that's what I'm opening up now. And I'll show
1:36:52
you where those settings are located. There's actually two things here that we
1:36:58
have to make sure get enabled.
1:37:08
All right. So, in the security section, we would want to expand Foundation software and then we would want to
1:37:15
expand the users and see our list of users. Uh, and for the system to be able to do
1:37:22
that check, um, it gets it gets triggered, uh, the alert gets triggered when someone signs into Foundation for
1:37:29
the first time that day. Now, the thing is, it's only going to trigger that alert when specific users
1:37:35
sign into the system. And the criteria for those users are going to be any users that have email settings fully set
1:37:41
up, which I do not, of course. Um, so they would need to have their loon, their password, you know, any of the
1:37:47
server information set up. And then they'll also need to have this this check box turned on as well, allow
1:37:53
trigger of conditional alerts. If you've got a user that's set up with their emails and everything, but this is not
1:37:59
turned on, them signing in is still not going to trigger the alert that we're talking about. So, you'll want to make
1:38:04
sure that you get these emails set up and then also turn on this uh trigger of conditional alerts checkbox.
1:38:14
All right, now we are getting ready to wrap things up here. Close out of this
1:38:20
window. Um, so just a brief summary recap of
1:38:25
what we've gone through and we got to look at different image types that we can upload. And oh, you know what?
1:38:31
Actually, I'm sorry. I'm not quite done just yet. There is one other thing I do want to show you here. Let me close out.
1:38:46
All right. So, I wanted to show you some of the other options that we get in this daily document manager.
1:38:51
I'm going to pull this back up. Bear with me here.
1:38:59
This daily document manager is is its main purpose is going to be for approvers and AP people to come in and,
1:39:06
you know, take action on on different items that they need to. Um, but there's some other other features here that I
1:39:11
want to show you that can be pretty useful. Um, so within this daily document manager, u there's some other buttons
1:39:18
across the top that I haven't really mentioned yet. Um, some of them are are less used, but um, we've got an other
1:39:24
recipient section, uh, which is pretty large for what it is, but this would just show you if you received an invoice
1:39:31
that someone else also received through the routing process. It would show you, um, a list of the other users that have
1:39:37
received that item. Um, there's a note section where you can go to view any notes that are created. You can respond
1:39:43
to notes, create new notes here, delete notes. Um, there's a label section, and
1:39:48
this is where you're going to see your list of labels, but it's also where you can add new labels or edit them to change their descriptions of their
1:39:54
little image. Um, I do want to show you this feature actually. Uh, if we click add here, it just gives us a little
1:40:00
popup window where we can choose an icon and give it a description here.
1:40:26
I apologize again for the speed here. It's just because it's installed locally on my workstation, but you guys should
1:40:32
be used to a little bit faster. But
1:40:41
there it is. It was just hiding behind it. Okay. So, this is our our ad label window. And you can see there's a bunch
1:40:47
of different icons that we can choose from. You know, there's hundreds of them here. Um, and you could just choose
1:40:52
whatever one you think visually makes the most sense. Um, and then you can give it a little description for whatever that is going to represent. Uh,
1:41:00
and this this can be useful in the routing process, but again, it can also be really useful for finding different types of documents that you might be
1:41:06
looking for. Um, so yeah, just keep that in mind. Definitely a good feature.
1:41:13
Other things you can do here, uh, we can go to a messages section. Uh, this is a
1:41:18
little outdated. You know, you've got alerts and notifications that'll kind of help you with this stuff. Now, um, but this is just going to show you a running
1:41:24
list of all the activity that's taking place with things that that that you're a part of, um, in this routing process.
1:41:30
Uh, it is kind of nice because if we wanted to, we can select these alerts and then we can open the selected record
1:41:36
in Foundation. Um, so just like you can click that little Foundation logo on your routed document section, uh, you
1:41:43
can click that shortcut from the messages section to open it up as well. Most people seem to prefer this button
1:41:49
though. And then the big one I wanted to show you here is going to be our document search.
1:41:57
Now this is where we can just search for documents in mass if we wanted to pull or gather a bunch of different images
1:42:02
that have been uploaded in the system. Uh this is also a good way just to see a complete list of everything that we're
1:42:08
able to attach images to. So you can see here when we're when we're searching for a document, we get a primary search
1:42:14
option like what records we want to look through. And these are just all the different records you can attach things
1:42:19
to. you know, time cards, sites, bids, POS, all kinds of stuff here. So,
1:42:25
definitely keep this in mind if you're wanting to look through it and get any kind of ideas and whatnot.
1:42:31
Now, I'm actually going to be searching through jobs for today because I've got some test images in there.
1:42:47
All righty. And then based on primary search that you select, you get access to different
1:42:52
criteria as well. So you can see now that I've chosen jobs, I can choose if I want to look at active jobs or inactive
1:42:58
jobs and what all this stuff here. And then this is where the labels can
1:43:03
become pretty useful as well. You know, if I'm looking for all of my W9s for my vendors to make sure they're all up to
1:43:08
date, I can turn that on. It'll just pull in all those W9s. In fact, I think I have some W9's in here. Let's use that
1:43:14
as an example. Um, so I'm looking at all jobs, active, closed, any of the above.
1:43:20
Um, and I'm going to search just for vendor W9. And we'll go ahead and hit find.
1:43:38
And there we go. Um, actually I may have put the wrong labels on
1:43:43
these, I suppose.
1:43:50
Get out of that.
1:43:57
I thought I put subcractor on those. Let me do job plans instead here.
1:44:11
There we go. So, now we've got our job plans coming up here. that we can view. And then from here, if
1:44:17
we select an image, if you look across the top, you've got um different options. You can export it if you just
1:44:22
wanted to save it to your desktop. You could print it. Um that'll also allow you to print to PDF if you wanted to.
1:44:28
And then we can also email it directly out of the system if we need to as well.
1:44:34
All right. Now that we've gotten through this daily document manager, I do think this is a
1:44:40
good place to start wrapping things up. Um so little reminder here the recording
1:44:46
uh is going to take about a day to get um you know condensed and formatted and everything and then um you should get an
1:44:51
email from goto webinar uh with the ability to to view that recording and then you can also view our YouTube
1:44:58
playlist um and see the the recording there. I believe we also will be uploading it to the client portal.
1:45:05
um you know, if there's anything further that you want to look into with this or if you're you're wanting to get some one-on-one training time or anything
1:45:10
like that, we do have lots of options for for paid one-on-one training. And if you look in the uh handout section of
1:45:17
the Goto Webinar, there's a little flyer there that will include a lot of the details with that. Uh and then one last
1:45:24
thing to mention here is that when we end the meeting, uh there is going to be a little survey that pops up. It is a
1:45:30
pretty quick survey to fill out. It doesn't take too much time. Uh, and if you guys don't mind filling that out, it
1:45:35
does really help us with deciding on what topics we're going to be covering in the future and if we need to change
1:45:40
anything with how we're we're handling these webinars. Um, and it just helps us to make sure that that you guys are as
1:45:46
our clients are getting the most out of these webinars that you can. So, um, if you could take a couple minutes to fill
1:45:51
that out, it would be greatly appreciated. And with all that being said, I hope you all have a great rest of your day and
1:45:58
good luck with everything.
