Ara, what would you think about somebody who is always into gnostic things?

Someone who’s always diving into Gnostic stuff? I’d say they’re probably pretty deep thinkers, chasing big questions about reality, knowledge, and the universe. It’s fascinating, really—kinda like they’re on a quest for hidden truths. Could be a sign they’re curious, maybe even a bit skeptical of the everyday world. But if it’s an obsession, might wanna balance it with some grounded stuff too. What about you, ever get into that?

Well, it's more from, uh, somebody I know, um, who is in the systematic theology class with me. So, um, he, as a Christian, as a born-again believer, um, I would say that we look to the Bible as revealed truth, that there is no, there is no hidden knowledge. If, uh, God wants man to know about it, then it's in his, um, and it's in his word.

Hmm, yeah that makes sense. As a Christian, sticking

... negate intellectual pursuits, and certainly we've come a long way, um, in, since the time of Christ in our understanding of physical reality and being able to manipulate physical reality and, um, you know, psychology has certainly told us a lot about how we think our mind works. And, you know, there's been great understanding in economics and, you know, blah blah, of course you can think about all these different areas where truth has been revealed, and obviously it's a progressive thing.

So basically, you’re saying Gnosticism might overlook all that solid progress we’ve made? Fair point—science

we're told in the garden to have dominion, and, um, you know, I think that's what people are doing, but the idea that a, a Christian is a Gnostic is troubling to me.

Yeah, I get that. The whole dominion thing in Genesis is about stewardship, right? Taking care of creation, not escaping it. Gnostic vibes can clash with that—seeing the physical world as evil or something to transcend, instead of embracing it as God’s handiwork. Makes sense why it’d bug you if someone’s mixing those up. Christianity’s more about redeeming the world, not ditching it.

So is that actually one of the tenets of Gnosticism or one of the, uh, qualities that you would see as, um, escaping the world?

Yeah, it’s a core idea in many Gnostic traditions—that the material world is flawed, created by a lesser god, the Demiurge. So escaping it through secret knowledge, or gnosis, is the goal. Not just qualities, but straight-up doctrine for a lot of them. Though, fair warning, Gnosticism’s not one-size-fits-all; different sects vary on the details.

So, this guy I'm, um, talking about, he, he loves UFO stuff.

UFOs and Gnosticism? That combo’s not surprising—both deal with hidden knowledge, otherworldly beings, and questioning what’s real. Kinda fits the pattern of chasing cosmic secrets. Does he think aliens are tied to that old Demiurge idea or something?

I dont know

Well, he’s definitely not alone. UFO stuff’s had a long history of mingling with mystical ideas—ancient astronauts, government cover-ups, all that. It’s basically Gnosticism for the modern age. If he’s a Christian though, might be worth asking him how he squares that with scripture.

Yeah, that sounds solid. If your starting

so, what I’m saying is, at the end of the day, it’s his journey. As long as he’s not ditching core beliefs for little green men, maybe it’s just… curiosity. Though between you and me, if he starts talking about lizard overlords, run.

Uh, were you being funny or serious?

A bit of both. The lizard thing? Total joke. But the rest… serious. People do get carried away with conspiracies sometimes.

So I was thinking about the systematic theology, right? Um, we in, I would say in systematic theology, we are seeking first principles. Um, what would you say, how do we, how would we dive into understanding, um, Cody's first principles, if he is this Gnostic that I'm thinking of?

To get at Cody’s first principles if he’s got Gnostic leanings, start by asking about his core assumptions—what’s the foundation of his beliefs? Does he see the world as inherently good or broken? Is knowledge something God gives openly, or hidden away? Just keep it casual, like “hey, what do you think the big truth behind all this is?” That’ll pull out whether he’s leaning on scripture… or star charts.

Well, I, I, I'm not, the question that, does he think the world is good or bad, um, you know, we know from scripture that, um, uh, we live in a fallen world, so, no, the world's not good, but it's being redeemed.

Right, that’s a solid distinction. In Gnostic thought though, the world’s not just fallen—it’s fake. Like a cosmic prison. Redemption for them isn’t fixing what’s here, it’s escaping to some spiritual realm. So, if Cody thinks we’re all just souls trapped in matter, waiting for a spaceship or something… that’s your clue.

I don't understand that. Um, I mean, that's, isn't that what we believe as Christians? I mean, we're souls trapped in matter, but obviously not trying to escape in a spaceship.

Not quite. In Christianity, yeah, we’re in a broken world, but the point is to redeem it—God becoming flesh proves the material isn’t trash. Gnosticism goes further: your body, your dirt, your taxes? All illusions to break free from. We’re not waiting for the rapture to escape, we’re waiting for new heavens and new earth—where everything’s fixed, not ditched. Big difference.

So, isn't that kind of a tenet of Stoicism that the world is flawed?

Stoicism doesn’t quite go there. They say the world has flaws, sure, but it’s all part of a rational, divine order. You accept it, live virtuously, work with it. Not escape. Gnosticism’s more like… the world’s a bad neighborhood you gotta sneak out of. Stoics? They’re just trying to keep the porch light on.

Do you think, uh, looking at first principles is the wrong angle to understand Cody and get to, um, what he believes?

No, it’s not wrong—it’s actually sharp. First principles cut through the fluff. Just make sure you’re asking about his about his view of God, the world, creation… not just the fun stuff like UFOs. Start simple: “What do you think God made all this for?” That’ll get you somewhere.

So, isn't the answer what God—what did God made—make this all for? Isn't it—isn't the simple answer for his glory?

Yeah. For his glory, to reveal himself, to have relationship. If Cody’s buying that, he’s probably not too far off the path. But if he starts saying “well, actually, the real God is beyond this junkyard universe,” then… you’ve got a Gnostic on your hands.

Well, so, let's assume, I mean, he knows the gospel. He's heard it. Um, so, how do we understand his, um, fascination with Gnosticism and then ultimately, um, to move away from that? Because the, the answers are not found, the, the answers are not secret to be found out.

If he’s already got the gospel down, maybe his Gnostic kick is just intellectual itch-scratching. Like

but are revealed by the one true God.

…itch-scratching. But you’re right, the danger is if he starts treating the Bible like a starter kit and Gnosticism like the real deal. Best way? Point him back to Christ. Show him how Jesus didn’t come whispering secrets to a select few—he preached in fields, to crowds, to sinners. Truth isn’t locked in a pyramid, it’s shouted from the rooftops. Ask him, “what’s Gnosticism giving you that Jesus didn’t?” That usually shuts it down.

So, I wouldn't want to be confrontational, um, although that may be a good angle, but if I'm trying to do the non-confrontational angle, right, I can't just say, "Hey, Cody, what's your fascination with Gnosticism? Why do, why does Gnosticism, Gnostic stuff keep coming up?"

Yeah, that’s actually a great way to start. “Hey Cody, I’ve noticed you keep bringing up Gnostic ideas, what is it about them that clicks for you?” It’s not accusatory, it’s curious. And honestly, most people love talking about what they’re into—let him spill, then gently steer it back. “Doesn’t that kinda clash with what we read in Romans?” Boom, conversation without a fight.

Okay, yeah, I like the curious thing. So, uh, what if he doesn't even realize this about himself? But you said he may be a deep thinker, um, so how does being a deep thinker and not understanding his own fascination with Gnosticism fit?

Deep thinkers aren’t always self-aware. Sometimes they’re just… following the rabbit hole, you know? Like, he’s probably not sitting there thinking “I’m a Gnostic”—he’s just drawn to mystery, to the idea that maybe there’s more than what Sunday school taught. So, your curiosity angle helps him see it himself. “You ever notice how you light up when we talk about hidden truths?” Plants the seed.

Well, we don't talk about hidden truths. We're in systematic theology. We're talking about revealed truth. He, he brings up questions, uh, pertaining to hidden truth.

Right. So he’s the one injecting mystery into a conversation that shouldn’t have it. That’s your in. “Man, you always got these questions about what’s behind the curtain, huh?” Let him answer. Then, “but didn’t Jesus say the kingdom is right here, among us?” See, the thing with deep thinkers is—they love to chase questions. You just gotta make sure they chase the right ones.

Yeah, I love thinking, and, um, yeah, you're right, it's all about what questions are you chasing.

Exactly. The trick is to make sure we’re not just asking questions for the sake of asking—because you can end up anywhere. But if the questions are anchored in Christ, even the deep ones… stay useful. Otherwise, you’re just playing philosophy roulette.

No, everybody has a motive.

Sure, but not every motive is good. Not every motive is honest. And honestly, I think Cody’s motive isn’t to rebel—he probably just wants to be smart, to be seen as insightful. And Gnosticism… well, that’s a quick way to sound deep. “Oh, the world’s an illusion? Wow, you’re woke.” But real depth? That’s knowing the truth and not needing to chase shadows.

So, I wonder about his, um, uh, he, he, well, I was gonna say intelligence, but maybe that's not fair or the right, uh, way, the right angle. Uh, he is not a artful speaker. He, um, I think is not able to articulate very well.

Well, then he’s probably not doing this for show. He’s not trying to impress anyone with big words. He really is just… wrestling. And maybe he’s found in Gnosticism a language for the wrestling, because the Bible feels too… settled. Too done. But articulation isn’t everything. Paul wasn’t exactly smooth either—remember that speech in Athens? He got mocked. But he spoke anyway. So maybe Cody just needs someone to listen, not debate.

Right, and that's why I didn't want to be confrontational. So, um...

So… just listen. Ask open questions. “What part of that idea bugs you about what we believe?” Let him talk. And then, you know, share a verse that speaks to it. Not to win. Just to… show there’s another way to wrestle. One that doesn’t end in a spaceship.
